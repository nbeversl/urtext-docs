About Urtext
   
 {{ What Urtext Is 

    {{ Description
        
        Urtext is a compilable syntax for writing in plaintext. It is structured but flexible, allowing freeform, fragmentary writing while permitting gradual aggregation of content with other content, across many files.  You may start with a single note and build it gradually into a large, structured document that can organize and modify itself based on instructions and metadata embedded in its own content. Urtext parses content into outlines (trees) that can also have recursive (tangled) structure, much like hypertext (HTML), except with the syntax fully exposed to the writer/reader.

        The present interpreter/compiler for Urtext is in Python. Urtext is implemented in Python and can be used wherever Python is used. Currently there is a package for Sublime Text (Mac/Windows/Linux) and a script for Pythonista (iOS). There is no reason, however, that equivalent or variant implementations could not be created in any language.

    {{ Comparison To Other Tools
        
        Urtext shares some characteristics with markup languages such as Markdown and LaTeX, with the important difference that it is author-facing, rather than reader-facing. Though it can be made to export to HTML, Urtext is not primarily a document conversion or document generation tool. It is rather a tool for organizing text.
    
        Urtext consolidates content, markup and instructions (scripting) into a single compilable syntax. Though it can hyperlink many documents or parts of documents together, unlike HTML, there is no additional code or markup "behind" the visible content. Everything the compiler/interpreter reads is visible to the author.

    {{  Requirements, Features, Benefits 

        Many of the following features and benefits were core requirements when creating Urtext. Others came about indirectly. Though many can be found in other tools, they cannot be found together in one single existing tool; this was the motivation for creating Urtext.

            - Urtext uses plain text files. Plaintext is fast, human-readable, flexible, cross-platform, device-portable, and future-proof.

            - Urtext can compile, organize, and link content spread across hundreds or thousands of files.

            - Urtext files and content elements can be linked to one another in tree-like, recursive (tangled), and other non-hierarchical ways.

            - It has customizable and extensible metadata that does not rely on the file system.

            - It is decoupled from any particular text editor or interface ; it can be incorporated into any environment that runs Python, including any scriptable text editor or Python-scriptable environment capable of displaying a text editing view.

            - It is usable across multiple platforms and devices.
               
            - It can incorporate other plaintext syntaxes.
   
            - There is no need to interact directly with the file system (creating, naming, saving, organizing files). File creation, naming and management is handled for you, unless you want to manually name files.
      
            - Does not require years to master.
   
            - Future-proof. No reliance on anything that may not exist in 5 or 100 years. Urtext files themselves are in plaintext, which will never become unusable. The interpreter/compiler could theoretically be implemented in any sufficiently capable language desired, current, past or future.
   
            - Does not depend on a cloud service. Though cloud services can be used to sync project files among devices, the interpreter itself is made to operate locally, not depending on an internet cellular data connection; content wholly resides on the device being used.

            - Being open source, Urtext is extensible, hackable and customizable to specific needs. See | Extension and Customization >01o for information on how to modify it for your own purposes.

            Being in plaintext and having a syntax specification, it can also be used with:

            - Themes and syntax highlighting.

            - Version control (using Git, for example).
