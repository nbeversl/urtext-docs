Collections

Collections are for "collecting" metadata entries, along with their context, in order to gain a range of views into the text content of a project. A common use for this would be to create a timeline from datetimestamps. Another use would be to collect all metadata entries of a given key, and optionally a given value, into a single view. 

[[   ID(>aoq)
     +(*) <- In order to return anything, we must include some nodes in the query. Here we have included all nodes.
     COLLECT(implementation=*)
     LIMIT(5)
     ]]

{ ID::aoq
def::>00k
}



id::00k;
