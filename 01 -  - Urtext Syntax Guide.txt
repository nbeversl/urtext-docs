Urtext Syntax Guide

Text is plain content unless inside a metadata wrapper, timetamp wrapper, or dynamic definition wrapper. The following syntax applies:

	 >0y2	Link to another node by ID. 
	 		More information: | Links >0y2

	 | 		Placed before a node link, dynamically populates the node title. 
	 		Example and more info: | Dynamically Titled Links >4vu

	 >>xxx	Node Pointer
	 		Embeds the specified node as though it were included inline using {{ }}
	 		More information: | Pointers >lmu

	 ^		Compact Node marker. Must be the first non-whitespace character on a line.
	 		More information: | Compact Nodes >j6t

	{{  }}	Subnode	wrapper. Can appear anywhere. Can be nested aribrarily deep.
			More information: | Inline Nodes >004

	/-- --/	Metadata wrapper

		Example:

		/--
			
			[key]:[value]		
			Metadata Pair, can contain any keys/values and optional timestamp.
				- Pairs must be separated by a semicolon or a new line
				- Keys are case-insensitive.
				- Keys must be single words. Underscore/dash character is valid.
				- Some keys are reserved (see below). 

			;					
			Separator for metadata key/value pairs

			|															
			Separator for multiple values in metadata pairs

			Reserved Metadata Keys, With Example Vales:

				id: znj
				Uniquely identifies the node in the project. Required in strict mode.
				more info: | More About Node IDs >01q

				index:01					
				Sets the index (priority) of the node in the project. 
				more info: | index >00z

				timestamp:<Wed., Jun. 05, 2019, 10:01 PM>					
				Timestamp. more info: | Timestamps >005

				title: Urtext Syntax Guide								
				Overrides the Node Title. more info: | title (overrides the default title) >00y

				flags:								
				Sets node behavior. More info: | flags >cwb

				from:Joes-iMac
				Hostname of originating computer/device.

	[[ ]]	Dynamic Definition Wrapper. 

			Template:
			[[ FUNCTION(key:value:<timestamp> operator) ]]

			Examples:
			
			[[ 	ID(xxx) 	Target Node id to dynamically populate with output

				INCLUDE()  	Nodes to include. Accepts one or multiple parameters.
							
							Examples:

							INCLUDE(all)	
							Includes all nodes in the project

							INCLUDE(indexed)	
							Includes all nodes in the project that have an index

							INCLUDE(key:value)	
							Includes all nodes with the given value in the given key

								Operators:

								"and"
								INCLUDE(key:value and other_key:other_value)
								Includes nodes matching both `key:value` and `other_key:other_value`

								"or"
								INCLUDE(key:value or other_key:other_value)
								Includes any nodes matching either or both of `key:value` and `other_key:other_value`

								"all_projects"
								INCLUDE(all_projects)
								Expands included nodes to include all projects in the project list.

								Optional Timestamp:
								
								INCLUDE(tags:cello:<2019> or tags:teaching:<2019>)
								Includes any nodes matching either or both of the key/value pairs within the corresponding timestamp.

				EXCLUDE()	Accepts the same parameters as INCLUDE()
							Evaluated after INCLUDE(), excludes the specified nodes from the result.

				SORT()		Sorts the results. Accepts multiple parameters:

							SORT(
								$key_name		Sorts by the value of the given key. Default is alphabetical.	
								timestamp   	Sort by timestamp instead of alphabetical
								last_accessed	Sort by last accessed
								reverse			Reverse sort order 
								)

				LIMIT()		Limits the output to the specified number of results.

							Example:
							LIMIT(30)

				SHOW()		Formats the output, overriding defaults. 
							Accepts arbitrary text, unicode newline characters (\n, \r), and words preceded (without whitespace) by `$`, which are are evaluated as metadata keys. Key names are
							not displayed, only values. Add keynames manually if you want them included.

							Example:
							SHOW(Author: $author, Date: $date\n)

							In addition to user-defined metadata keys, the following tokens are valid:

							SHOW(

								$title 
								Displays the node title, default or via the `title` meta key

								$link
								Displays a link to the node

								$date 
								Displays the node's date in the project's default timestamp format

								$meta
								Shorthand to show all metadata for every node, formatted as by "consolidate metadata"

								$contents:120
								Displays the contents of the node. Optional excerpt/length specifier after the colon

								)

				TREE(xxx)		Outputs a tree of the hierarchy of nested nodes, with the specified node as root.
								Does not incorporate INCLUDE() or EXCLUDE().

				TIMELINE()		Outputs the specific nodes as a timeline.

								Accepts one of two arguments. If more than one is present, only the first one is
								evaluated.

								TIMELINE(meta)		Uses dates from node metadata

								TIMELINE(inline)	Parses dates from inline timestamps

				FORMAT()		Formats the exported output. Accepts one or more predefined arguments:
								
								FORMAT(preformat) 	
								Wraps preformatted text (trees, etc.) in backticks to preserve formatting in 
								Markdown contexts. Used only with EXPORT().

								FORMAT(multiline_meta)
								Places dynamic node metadata on separate lines instead of separated by ;

								FORMAT(indent:30)
								Indents the dynamic node by the specified number of spaces

				METADATA()		Applies the given metadata to the output node. Accepts any number of key/value
								pairs with optional timestamps.


				SEARCH()		Returns search results of the string passed as an argument.
								Searches are case-insensitive.

								Example:
								SEARCH("western civilization")

				

				EXPORT()		Exports the specified node id to a file and/or other node in the project.

								EXPORT (
									source:xxx		Specifies the source node id
									plaintext 		Export as plaintext (default)
									markdown		Export as markdown
									html			Export as HTML
								)

				FILE()			Used only with EXPORT(). Outputs the export to the specified filename.

								FILE(myfile.txt)

				TAG_ALL()		Applies the specific metadata to all nodes in the target node. Accepts any number
								of key/value pairs with optional timestamps.

								Example:
								TAG_ALL(
									tasks:due_soon		key/value pair to apply
									recursive			(optional) applies metadata also to all descendants	
								)

				Notice the dynamic definition syntax ignores whitespace and arbitrary text outside of functions.
