Nodes

A node is region, or set of regions, of a file, up to and including the entire file. A file is itself a node. All nodes can contain other nodes.

The identity of an Urtext node persists no matter its containing filename. This is accomplished by assigning each node a unique identifier of alphanumeric characters, providing over 46,000 possible nodes per project. (It is possible to use files containing no IDs in an Urtext project, but then most of the features of Urtext are lost.)

Urtext generates IDs automatically on creation of new nodes. ID's can be changed without affecting functionality, though links must then be manually updated as well. 

Node IDs are assigned in random order and have no special meaning except as a unique identifier. | Node IDs >01q.
 
Types of nodes:

	By default, the first non-whitespace line of any node is the node's title.
