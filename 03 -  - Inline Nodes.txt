Inline Nodes                                                                 
	 
    The syntax for inline nodes is to wrap the content in curly braces:

      { Example Inline Node  id::00e }

    Create an inline nodes with `Ctrl-Shift-squiggly-brace. Inside the inserted double curly braces is a new node with an auto-generated ID.   

    To wrap existing content into an inline node, first select the content and use the same keypress.

    Nodes can be nested arbitrarily deep inside other nodes, whether the parent node is a file or another inline node. When syntax highlighting is active, inline node wrappers are tinted to showing nesting level:
        
        {  Example first level 
            { second level 
                { third level
                    { fourth level 
                        {   fifth level  
                        5pq}  
                    80d}  
               6qj}  
            8fv}  
        y9t}

    Note that every opening doubly curly bracket must be closed in the same file and requires an ID between its opening and closing brackets. The examples above use | Trailing Node IDs >2a3. You can also use regular | Metadata >00x as at the bottom of this file.

    Note that nodes at the file level (| Files >ekz) do not use curly-braces, as their region boundaries are defined by the file itself.

    For all purposes in Urtext, inline nodes' identity is unique from their containing file, parent nodes, and child nodes.
