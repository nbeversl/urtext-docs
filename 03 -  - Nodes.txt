Nodes

A node is region, or set of regions, of a file, up to and including the entire file. A file is itself a node. All nodes can contain other nodes.

The identity of an Urtext node persists no matter its containing filename, even when moved from one file to another. This is accomplished by assigning each node a unique identifier of alphanumeric characters, providing over 46,000 possible nodes per project. It is possible to use files containing no IDs in an Urtext project, but then most of the benefits of Urtext are lost. 

Each node's ID is generated automatically on creation and placed into its initial metadata region. ID's can be changed without affecting functionality, though links must then be manually updated as well. 

Node IDs are assigned in random order and have no special meaning except as a unique identifier. | More About Node IDs >01q .
 
{{ Files

	The most basic node is a single file. It may or may not contain other nodes nested inside it.

	To create a new file, press `Urtext-;`. A new file is created, named and saved automatically. It has whitespace on top and a metadata block at the bottom containing a node ID and (by default) a creation timestamp.

By default, the first non-whitespace line of any node is the node's title.
