Inline Nodes                                                                 
	 
    Nodes can be nested arbitrarily deep inside other nodes, whether the parent node is a file or another inline node. The syntax for inline nodes is to wrap the content in double curly braces like this:

      {{ Example Inline Node 
ID::00e }}

    Create an inline nodes with `Ctrl-Shift-{`. Inside the inserted double curly braces is a new node with an auto-generated ID. 
          
    To wrap existing content into an inline node, first select the content and use the same keypress.
          
    Like everything in Urtext syntax, you can do this manually by typing the curly braces and generating a new metadata region with an ID by pressing Ctrl-Shift-i. 

    Urtext requires attention to syntax. Every opening doubly curly bracket must be closed in the same file and requires an ID metadata tag between its opening an closing brackets.

    NOTE that nodes at the file level (see | Files >ekz) do not use curly-braces, as their region boundaries are defined by the file itself.

    For all purposes in Urtext, inline nodes' identity is unique from their containing file, parent nodes, and child nodes.
