Metadata

Every node can have an unlimited number of metadata entries. Metadata is indexed and becomes searchable and sortable. Other than a few reserved key/value pairs, metadata is user-defined. 

Metadata can be added to text in two ways: using wrapped blocks, or using inline notation:

{{ Wrapped

    Wrapped metadata blocks can be inserted arbitrarily anywhere inside a node. Metadata blocks open with a forward-slash followed by two dashes and close with two dashes followed by a forward slash: 
  

    Wrapped metadata can be either free-form, such as the example above, or structured in colon-separated key/value pairs, with the value (to the right of the colon) containing an optional timestamp. Examples:

        purpose::This node describes Metadata in Urtext <Thu., Jun. 11, 2020, 09:09 PM>
        audience::Urtext user 

      Separated multiple entries using either a new line or a semicolon. Using the semicolon option, several entries may be strung together on a single line. 

    Note that:

    -   A colon separates the key from the value 

    -   All three components are optional; any content preceding a colon (if one is present) is interpreted as a key. Content following the (first) colon is interpreted as a value. 

    -   If no colon is present, the entry is read as a value with the default key `comment`.

    -   A timestamp anywhere in the value will be indexed as the timestamp for the whole metadata entry. If more than on timestamp appears in an entry, only the first one is indexed. iy7}}


{{ Inline
    
    Individual metadata key/value pairs can also be inserted anywhere in the text without a wrapper, using a double colon (` :: `) notation. 
      example_key::example_value. 

    Inline metadata entries remember their location in the text, making them double as contextual markers and sort indexes.

    Inline metadata entries do not include the option of timestamps. Instead, you may insert inline timestamp notation. See | Timestamps >005

    {{  Case-sensitivity

        -   Values are not case-sensitive, except those with the following keys:

            `title`             Manually overrides the node's title. {{ **Needs edit/organization here about Node Titles. 
id::hof
tags::edit
created::<Thu., Jun. 11, 2020, 04:40 PM> }}
            `comments           ( This key is assumed when no key is present; used for freeform comments. )
            `notes`             ( as for `comments` )
            `weblink`           ( used for HTTP/S links. See | Linking to outside resources >00q )

            The rest are used only in the project_settings node (see | project_settings >00l) :

            `timestamp_format`  
            `filenames`         
            `project_title`
            `timezone`
            `timestamp_format`

          
id::l36 }}

   {{ Reserved Keys

      There are two reserved keys that Urtext interprets in a special way:

        {{   `index`
      
           Provides a way to give nodes a sort order in | The Node Browser >01i.  Indexed nodes will sort before (above) the others, lowest numbers appearing first. To utilize, add a two-digit sort index (00-99) to a node, such as: 
index::03    

           You can give the same index number to multiple nodes; in this case they sort first by index, then by timestamped, newest first.

           Unindexed nodes will display underneath indexed nodes, by timestamp, newest first.

       {{  `flags`

           Used to set node behavior for specific purposes withing Urtext. At present only the following exists:

           - {{  `exclude_from_tree`

               Excludes a node from being included in a tree. For an example, see Example 2 in "Dynamic Nodes" | Example 2 : Tree >029. For more on tree, see | Trees >00h  

           
id::1e3 }}


            - {{ `exclude_from_export`

                Excludes a node from being exported, when project content is exported. See | Converting and Exporting >ezg.
