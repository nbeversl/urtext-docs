Metadata

{ Syntax

  Every node can have an unlimited number of metadata entries. Metadata gets indexed and becomes searchable and sortable from anywhere within the project. Metadata entries also "remember" their location in the text, making them operate as contextual markers. Other than a few reserved key/value pairs, metadata is user-defined.  

  Metadata is structured in double-colon-separated key/value pairs, with the value (to the right of the colon) containing an optional timestamp. Examples:

        purpose::This node describes Metadata in Urtext <Thu., Jun. 11, 2020, 09:09 PM>
        audience::Urtext user 

  Keys must be single words, though characters such as dash and underscore are allowed. Values may include spaces. Terminate metadata entries using either a new line or a semicolon. Using the semicolon option, several entries may be strung together on a single line:

      one_key::some value; another_key::some_other_value <Thu., Sep. 10, 2020, 05:37 PM>;
      
  Note that a timestamp anywhere in the value will be indexed as the timestamp for the whole metadata entry. If more than on timestamp appears in an entry, only the first one is indexed.  kga}

{  Case-sensitivity

      -   Values are not case-sensitive, except those with the following keys:

          `title`             Manually overrides the node's title. 

          The rest are used only in the project_settings node (see | project_settings >00l) :

          `timestamp_format`  
          `filenames`         
          `project_title`
          `timezone`
          `timestamp_format`
  l36}

 { Reserved Keys

      There are two reserved keys that Urtext interprets in a special way:

      {   `index`
    
         Provides a way to give nodes a sort order in | The Node Browser >01i.  Indexed nodes will sort before (above) the others, lowest numbers appearing first. To utilize, add a two-digit sort index (00-99) to a node, such as:  index::03    
         You can give the same index number to multiple nodes; in this case they sort first by index, then by timestamped, newest first.

         Unindexed nodes will display underneath indexed nodes, by timestamp, newest first. 00z}

       {  `_flags`

           Used to set node behavior for specific purposes withing Urtext. At present only the following exists:

            {  `exclude_from_tree`

               Excludes a node from being included in a tree. For an example, see Example 2 in "Dynamic Nodes" | Example 2 : Tree >029. For more on tree, see | Trees >00h  1e3}


            { `exclude_from_export`

                Excludes a node from being exported, when project content is exported. See | Converting and Exporting >ezg.   vv7}
