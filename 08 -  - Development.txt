{{  Make Installation Easier
	
	The way Sublime Text is currently set up, manually installing all the dependency modules is the easiest way to get it set up. Alternatives such as using git subtrees, wrapping each individual dependency in a separate Sublime Package and then making those Packages dependencies of the Urtext Package, etc., all end up involving both more maintenance and more legwork for the end user than just manually installing everything.

	If any developer can suggest a better solution, please submit a pull request.
