The `project_settings` Node

This is the `project_settings` node for the "Urtext Documentation" Urtext project. In the metadata for this node you can specify a handful of settings for the project. (The text content of the node does not matter.)

The `project_settings` node is optional. To create one, make a node and use metadata to give it the title `project_settings`:

Timestamp::<Sat., Jun. 08, 2019, 08:03 AM>
home::a5m
title::project_settings
project_title::Urtext Documentation
index::100
console_log::True

This node now has special reserved metadata keys that will be parsed as follows:
