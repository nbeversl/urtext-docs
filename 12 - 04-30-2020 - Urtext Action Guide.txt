Urtext Operations Guide

Urtext has some built-in operations that bound to either hotkeys or to UI menus. They are described here with their suggested hotkey:

Project Management:

	Multiple Projects
	Import Project
	Reload Project
	Reindex All Files
	Rename File(s) from Meta
	Delete This Node
	Initialize Project
	Pop Node
	Move File to Other Project


Navigation: 

	`h` 	Home  
			Go to the designated home page of the project. Define the home node in | project_settings >00l

	`<` 	Navigate Back
			Go to the previously visited node (web-browser-like navigation)

	`>` 	Navigate Forward 
			Go to the next visited node (web-browser-like navigation)

	`e`		Node List :
			Show a quick search bar of all nodes in the current project

	`*`		Global Node List:
			Show a quick search bar of all nodes in all known projects.

	(none) 	Jump to Source:
			When attempting to type or modify any dynamic node (export, tree, search, etc), the editor will jump to the source node of the text at the cursor's position.

Insertions:

	`t` 	Timestamp:
			Insert a timestamp at the cursor's location, in the project's default format. For setting timestamp format defaults, see | project_settings >00l

	`i` 	ID:
			Insert an arbitrary (unallocated) Node ID with metadata wrapper at the cursor position.


Editing:
	
	`g`: 	Editing History
			View the editing history for the currently viewed file.
			For more informatino see | File History >prp
	
	(menu)	Consolidate Metadata
			Consolidates all metadata tags in the node of the current cursor position, into a single wrapper.


Scratch Views
	
Several outputs performed by dynamic definitions (see | Urtext Syntax Guide >znj) can also be written into "scratch" (unsaved) views for temporary use, with the intention of discarding them afterward.

	(menu)	Timeline
	
	`n`		Search:
			See "SEARCH()" in | Urtext Syntax Guide >znj
	
	(menu)	Interlinks
		
	(menu)	Tree



Sublime Text Only:
	Traverse Mode
