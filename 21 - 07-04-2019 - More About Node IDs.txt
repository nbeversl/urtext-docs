More About Node IDs

The purpose of Node IDs is to uniquely identify each piece of content (node) in a project.

Nodes IDs are three characters long and incorporate all ten digits (0 - 9) and all letters a - z, resulting in over 46,000 possible unique identifiers per project.

Node IDs are generated automatically by Urtext; every newly created node is assigned an available unused ID. 

IDs have no special meaning, do not represent the order of node creation within a project, and are not related to or "hashed from" node content in any way. They are assigned in random order so the probability of accidentally creating two nodes with the same ID is minimal when using the project across many devices that may not always be in sync.

When an ID is deleted from a project, new nodes are later assigned to vacant node IDs.

{{ Inserting a Node ID manually

	Control-Shift-I will insert a new and unused node anywhere in the project, in case you delete one or want to insert one manually. /-- id: 04s --/ }}

Node IDs can also be user-created arbitrarily if for some reason you want to. If you do this, note that node IDs are case-insensitive.

If more than one Node ID appears in a node, only the first one is used as the Node's ID; the rest are treated (indexed) as regular metadata.

{{ 	Accidental Duplicate Node IDs

	If two nodes end up with the same ID, only one (the first one found) will be assigned the ID. The entire second FILE containing the node with the duplicate ID is omitted. The log will show a message to this effect. 

	To correct the problem, it is necessary to manually change the duplicate ID to a new one. To ensure the corrected node ID is unique, it is recommended to use control-shift-I for this (as described above), after the rest of the project is compiled.
