Full Text Search 
    
    Full text search is implemented in most modern desktop text editors and some mobile text editors and applications. However Urtext has a built-in search and index capability to avoid reliance on editors and environments. This feature utilizes the `whoosh` module by Matt Chaput, which generates indexes text content and stores ("pickles") it to disk for fast query and retrieval. 

	{{  Building the Index

	    Any time a new project is instantiated, Urtext creates an `index` folder inside the project folder for storing the search index. This is maintained by Urtext/whoosh and requires no user interaction/maintenance. The index is initially empty. Before using it for the first time, select `Urtext: Rebuild Search Index` from the command palette. This will take less than a second to several seconds or longer, depending on the number of files. From then on, nodes are reindexed every time a file is saved. If the index gets out of date/sync with the project for any reason (you notice search terms are not being found, or matches are found that no longer exist), use `Urtext: Rebuild Search Index` again.    /-- id: xqi --/ }}

	{{	Searching

		^ Sublime : select `Urtext: Search` from the command pallete. This provides an input panel on the lower edge of the screen. Dynamically search results will be shown in a scratch view as you enter search terms. Press ESC to cancel.

        ^ Pythonista : Use the "??" Urtext Button. Results will be updated in real time in the view behind the search field. To exit, tap outside the search field. /-- id: q8j; timestamp: <Mon., Feb. 24, 2020, 02:19 PM> --/

	{{ 	Dynamically Updated Searches (Dynamic Nodes)

        Search results can populate a dynamic node using the key-value pair:

            - search:(string)

        For example, the following definition targets node >3x3 (below) and populates it with all nodes containing the word "urtext".
        [[ 
        id:3x3
        search:urtext
        metadata:title:Example Search Results
        metadata:flags:exclude_from_tree
        ]]

        {{
Example Search Results
/-- 
ID: 3x3
defined in: >uy4
flags: exclude_from_tree
title: Example Search Results
--/}}

 /-- id: uy4 --/ }}
