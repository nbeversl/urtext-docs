Exporting _
Urtext can export to plaintext, Markdown and HTML. Output can be written to a file or back into another node in the project. Exporting is dynamic; when changes are made to the source files, exports are immediately updated.

{  Example : Urtext Documentation Exported in Markdown to a File

    This dynamic definition exports the entire documentation from its root node | Urtext  Version: 1.0-beta  Usage Guide and References >a5m ) in Markdown format to a file called f>./README.md:

    [[ 
        We include four specific root nodes by ID:
        +(ID=p23) | About This Documentation >p23
        +(ID=013) | About Urtext >013
        +(ID=z7t) | Quick Start, Guides and Examples >z7t
        +(ID=ac5) | Reference >ac5
        
        DEPTH(*)
        The asterisk `*` is used for DEPTH, which will include unlimited children of each node. Note again that pointers resulting in recursive trees (circular references) will be drawn only to the first point of recursion. (See | Recursive Node Pointers >6ct.)

        SORT(index)

        For this documentation, we created a user-defined keyname `flags` to identify nodes that are examples/illustrations. We mark them for exclusion from the Table of Contents with they key `exclude_from_toc`. The following parameters accomplishes this:
        -(flags=exclude_from_export)    

        FORMAT( -preformat)

        EXPORT(f>README.md; -markdown)

{  Example : Fragment Exported to HTML _

    The following Dynamic Definition is identical to the above, except it exports to HTML.   

   [[   +(ID=p23) | About This Documentation >p23
        +(ID=013) | About Urtext >013
        +(ID=z7t) | Quick Start, Guides and Examples >z7t
        +(ID=ac5) | Reference >ac5
        DEPTH(*)
        SORT(index)
        FORMAT( -preformat)
        EXPORT(f>documentation.html; -html)

    ]]
