Search

   {{  Full Text Search 
    
    Fuzzy and Full Text Search are already implemented in many modern desktop text editors and some mobile text editors. However Urtext has a built-in search and index capability to avoid reliance on editors and environments. Urtext uses the `whoosh` module by Matt Chaput, which generates indexes from text content that are stored ("pickled") to disk for fast queries. 

	{{  Building the Index
	    Anytime a new project is instantiated, Urtext creates an `index` folder inside the project folder for storing the search index. This is maintained by Urtext/whoosh and requires no user interaction. The index is initially empty. Before using it for the first time, select `Urtext: Rebuild Search Index` from the command palette. This will take less than a second to several seconds or longer, depending on the number of files. From then on, nodes are reindexed every time a file is saved. If the index gets out of date/sync with the project for any reason (you notice search terms are not being found, or matches are found that no longer exist), use `Urtext: Rebuild Search Index` again.

	{{ 	Search Using Dynamic Nodes

        Search results can populate a dynamic node by using the key-value pair:

            - search:(string)

        For example, the following definition targets node >3x3 (below) and populates it with all nodes containing the word "urtext".
        [[ 
        id:3x3
        search:urtext
        metadata:title:Example Search Results
        metadata:flags:exclude_from_tree
        ]]

        {{
Example Search Results
/-- 
flags: exclude_from_tree
title: Example Search Results
defined in: >uy4
ID: 3x3
--/}}
