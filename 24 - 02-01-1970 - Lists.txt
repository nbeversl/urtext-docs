	Dynamic definitions can contain arbitrary text. The only parts read by the compiler are the function names with their parameters in parentheses. Like nodes, you can format/indent/comment these definitions any way you want.

	This definition targets ID m1r, which appears immediately below: | Example: Nodes from the Documentation >m1r.
	ID(>m1r) 

	The asterisk means to include all nodes in the project. 
	INCLUDE(*)

	The LIMIT parameter limits the output to the specified number of results. 
	Note that the default sort order is alphabetical. 
	LIMIT(20)

	Here the FORMAT parameter is used to indent the output 3 tabs.
	FORMAT(indent:3) 
	HEADER(Example: Nodes from the Documentation )
