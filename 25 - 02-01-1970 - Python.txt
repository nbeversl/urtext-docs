Python

        Pass the current line contents and cursor position (within the line) to the UrtextProject. The method returns the best link match. Find the filename as described in >h8c and open it at the start_position returned from get_link(). See the open_urtext_node() function in the Sublime Text package for an example. 

        %%-PYTHON

            UrtextProject.get_link( line, position=0 )
            """
            Args:
                line (string) : the current line from the text editor
            Kwargs:
                position (int) : cursor position
            Returns: tuple
                ('HTTP', url ), 
                ('NODE', node_id [string], start_position [int]),
                or None
            Notes:
                This looks first in the line around the cursor position, 
                then forward, then backward.
