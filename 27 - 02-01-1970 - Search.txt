Search

   {{  Full Text Search 
    
    Fuzzy and Full Text Search are already implemented in many modern desktop text editors and some mobile text editors. However Urtext has a built-in search and index capability to avoid reliance on editors and environments.
    
	{{	Searching

		^ Sublime : select `Urtext: Search` from the command pallete. This provides an input panel on the lower edge of the screen. Dynamically search results will be shown in a scratch view as you enter search terms. Press ESC to cancel.  Results include links to source nodes.

        ^ Pythonista : Use the "?" Urtext Button. Results will be updated in real time in the view behind the search field. To exit, tap outside the search field.

	{{ 	Search Using Dynamic Nodes

        Search results can populate a dynamic node by using the key-value pair:

            - search:(string)

        For example, the following definition targets node >3x3 (below) and populates it with all nodes containing the word "urtext".
        [[ 
        ID(3x3)
        METADATA(title:"Example Search Results" flags:exclude_from_tree)
        SEARCH(urtext)
        ]]
