	%%-DOC (<- This "pass marker" causes the Urtext compiler to ignore all Urtext syntax between here and the closing (END) marker, 
	for documentation purposes. For details see | Pass Markers and Embedded Syntaxes >oy5)

	
	All text is plain content unless inside a timetamp wrapper or dynamic definition wrapper. 
	The following syntax applies:

	{  }	Subnode	wrappers. Can appear anywhere. Can be nested aribrarily deep.
			More information: | Inline Nodes >004

	 >0y2	Link to another node by ID. 
	 		More information: | Links >0y2

	 | 		Placed before a node link, dynamically populates the linked node title.
	 		Example and more info: | Dynamically Titled Links >4vu


	 ^		Compact Node marker. Must be the first non-whitespace character on a line. id::83g
	 		More information: | Compact Nodes >j6t
		
	 >>ttt	Node Pointer
	 		Embeds the specified node as though it were included inline using wrappers { } (see above)
	 		More information: | Pointers >lmu

	< > 	Timestamp enclosure. Parses user-defined datetime strings, with some default formats built in.
			Example: <Tue., Jul. 28, 2020, 07:43 PM>
			More information: | Timestamps >005

	::		Metadata assignment operator. Accepts a user-defined key on the left, and values and timestamps on the right.
			Metadata may appear anywhere in text.
			Keys must be single words (underscore permitted), values may be any characters, terminated with a semicolon or newline.
			Example: example_key::example value for the key <Tue., Jul. 28, 2020, 73:39 PM>;
			
			The pipe character (`|`) separates multiple values.
			Example: some_key::one value | another value

			Metadata entries are attached in a general way to their containing (parent) node but also remember their 
			location and can serve as an anchor to their immediate context.
			More information: | Metadata >00x
	
			Trailing node ID:
			The last three characters of a node, if they are preceded by whitespace, can serve as the `id` metadata
			value of that node, to make them less obtrusive while reading/editing text.

{  Built-in Metadata Keys

	There are some built-in metadata keys. Built-in keys begin with an underscore character `_`.

	_title  				Overrides the Node Title

	_flags  				Sets node behavior. More info:| `_flags` >cwb

	A few additional keys are reserved, but only for nodes containing project settings. See | project_settings >00l.
