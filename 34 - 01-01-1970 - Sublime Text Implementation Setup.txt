Sublime Text Implementation Setup /-- tags:sublime --/

    A text editor with scripting capabilities can be seen as an empty, all-purpose user interface for working with plain text in any way. The Urtext package for Sublime Text utilizes Sublime Text's as a user interface for editing Urtext files, using Sublime's embedded Python interpreter both to run the Urtext interpreter/compiler and to add features to Sublime that make working with Urtext easy. The Sublime Text Urtext package:

        - binds Urtext's features to commands in the Sublime command palette
        - adds key bindings (hotkeys) as shortcuts for some features
        - leverages the built-in Sublime browser/palette for Urtext project navigation
        - defines a syntax for use with Sublime's color schemes
        - adds Urtext syntax highlighting to two of Sublime's default color schemes (Monokai and Sixteen)
        - adds filebrowser-like project navigation using | Traverse Mode >00w

    Some features in this documentation are built into the Urtext interpreter/compiler, while others are part of only the Sublime Text implementation. Features that are specific to Sublime are tagged with the keyword `sublime`.

{{     Dependencies and Installation (Sublime)
    
        The decision has been made not to include Urtext or its dependencies in the Urtext package for Sublime. This is to simplify development of Urtext independently of particular contexts. As such, it is necessary to install everything manually into Sublime's Python environment, and to update them independently when desired.

        To use Urtext in Sublime Text:

            - Install Sublime Text ( https://www.sublimetext.com/ )

            - Clone or download Sublime Urtext ( https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_sublime ). Place it in your Packages folder (Sublime Text 3/Packages).

            - The following must then be manually added to Sublime's library folder (`Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`):

                - anytree
                    https://github.com/c0fec0de/anytree
                    The folder needed is `anytree` inside this download; add it to `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.

                - whoosh
                    https://bitbucket.org/mchaput/whoosh/downloads/
                    The folder needed is `src/whoosh`; add it to `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.

                - pytz
                    https://pypi.org/project/pytz/
                    The folder neded is `pytz`; add it to `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.

                - six
                    https://pypi.org/project/six/
                    The only FILE needed is `six.py`, nothing else; add this directly to `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.

                - urtext 
                    https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext
                    (This is Urtext itself.) Put the entire folder (`urtext`) into `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.

            In the future a script may be provided to install/update these dependencies, but for now it is a manual process.

            Close and reopen Sublime Text. Urtext is now ready to use.
