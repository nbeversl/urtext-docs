"Table of Contents" Dynamic Definition _

Here is the dynamic definition that generates the | Table of Contents >e5j for this documentation.

[[  ID(>e5j) (The target ID is the | Table of Contents >e5j)
	
	We include three specific root nodes by ID:
    +(ID=p23) | About This Documentation >p23
    +(ID=z7t) | Quick Start, Guides and Examples >z7t
    +(ID=ac5) | Reference >ac5

    Remember the order of parameters does not affect the output. We use SORT to preserve the order, from the `index` value of each root node:
    SORT(index)

    The documentation has a user-defined keyname `flags` to identify nodes that are examples/illustrations. We mark them for exclusion from the Table of Contents with they key `exclude_from_toc`:
	-(flags=exclude_from_toc)
 
    Here we use `*` for DEPTH, which means unlimited depth.
    DEPTH(*)
    Note that the documentation uses | Pointers >lmu which potentially result in recursive trees. In these cases, the tree will be drawn only to the first point of recursion. See | Recursive Node Pointers >6ct. 
     
    Finally, we add a header, which also will also automatically set the node title. 
    HEADER(Table of Contents)
 ]]  


[[ 
	As a curiosity, we can see all the nodes that have been excluded from the Table of Contents:
	+(flags=exclude_from_toc)
	HEADER(Nodes Excluded from the Table of Contents)
	ID(>jkl)
    FORMAT(indent:3)
    DEPTH(*)
    FOOTER(flags::exclude_from_toc | exclude_from_export)

 ]]

        {
