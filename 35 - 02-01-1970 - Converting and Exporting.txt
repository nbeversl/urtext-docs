Converting and Exporting

    Urtext can convert (export) nodes, and sets of nodes, to plaintext, Markdown and HTML. Results can be either output to a file or written back into another node within the same project. Like other dynamic functions, exporting is dynamic ; that is, when changes are made to the source nodes, exports are immediately updated, whether they are in a project node or an external file.

    Exporting is not implemented in user-interface menus/buttons. Instead, export by utilizing dynamic definitions.

    The export command has three components:

    	export : (format) : ( source_node_id )

        (format) : One of `plaintext`, `markdown` or `html`
        (source_id): The source node to export.

{{  Example : Urtext Documentation Exported in Markdown to a File

    The following dynamic definition exports this entire documentation (from its root node | Urtext Documentation >a5m ) in Markdown format to a file called documentation.md:
    [[ 
        FILE(README.md)
        EXPORT(source:a5m markdown)
        FORMAT(preformat)
        
     ]]


/-- id: m9d --/ }}

{{  Example : Fragment Exported to HTML

    The following Dynamic Definition exports the | Links and Pointers >00j section of the documentation to HTML, into a node inside this one:


/-- 
ID: baq
defined in: >plg
--/}}



/-- id: ezg --/
