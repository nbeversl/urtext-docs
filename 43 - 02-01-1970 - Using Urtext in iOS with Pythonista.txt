Using Urtext in iOS with Pythonista
 
Urtext can be run on iOS devices using Pythonista, which provides a full Python interpreter inside of iOS. It is available in the iOS App Store.

This implementation utilizes the native iOS user interface to create a basic text editor view, along with buttons bound to Urtext's functions (similar to the keyboard shortcut bindings in Sublime), project navigation funtions, and syntax highlighting matching those found in the Sublime Text implementation. Using iCloud, projects can be synced among iOS devices and other devices (desktops, laptops). Once synced, a copy of the project resides fully on the device and is not dependent on a live data connection (see | Project Requirements and Features >006).

To set it up:

    - Install Pythonista (http://omz-software.com/pythonista/)

    - Clone or download the Urtext-Pythonista package (https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_pythonista).

    - Install all the Python dependencies into your Pythonista environment. The requirements are the same as for Sublime Text (| Dependencies and Installation >2fn )

    - (optional) To enabling launching or switching to Urtext using an app icon, use the Shortcuts app.
