This documentation is in progress, still contains many formatting issues, and is somewhat behind development and features. Please post any questions as issues (https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext-docs/issues).

## Installation and Setup (Desktop)Installation and Setup (Desktop)

For desktop use (PC/Mac/Linux) Urtext is implemented in Sublime Text.

1. Download Sublime Text. (https://www.sublimetext.com/).

2. Download Urtext and all its dependencies from the monorepo at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. You can either download this repository as a .ZIP file and unzip it, or if you want to maintain version control, use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. Put the contents of the cloned/unzipped folder (important: not the folder itself) directly into your `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3` folder.

3. Download the Sublime Urtext package at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_sublime`. Place it in your Packages folder (Sublime Text 3/Packages)

4. Clone/download this documentation repository and open its folder in Sublime. It will automatically be read as an Urtext project.

Once the Sublime package is installed, it will always look for any files with the .txt extension in open folders and attempt to compile them into a project. To open an existing Urtext project, open the folder, a file in the folder, or a Sublime project that includes the folder, and any feature described in this documentation will work.

To make a new project, open an empty folder and select Select `Urtext : Initialize Project` from the Sublime Command Palette. For more information, see [Making a New Project](#making-a-new-project).

Dynamic Definitions

Dynamic definitions contain instructions for dynamically building nodes from the contents of other nodes. They can be written anywhere inside node content. It is not necessary to store the definition in the same file to which it refers.

Dynamic definitions are wrapped using double left and right square brackets:

Dynamic Definition Wrapper

Note the dynamic definitions ignore whitespace and arbitrary text outside of functions.
The order of functions within a definition is unimportant; they are evaluated as a group.






Urtext includes some built-in metadata keys. Built-in keys all begin with an underscore character `_`

_title  				Overrides the Node Title.

## Urtext Operations GuideUrtext Operations Guide

Urtext has some built-in operations that bound to either hotkeys or to UI menus. They are described here with their suggested hotkey:

Project Management:

Multiple Projects
Import Project
Reload Project
Reindex All Files
Rename File(s) from Meta
Delete This Node
Initialize Project
Pop Node
Move File to Other Project


Navigation: 

`h` 	Home  
Go to the designated home page of the project. Define the home node in [project_settings](#project_settings)

`` 	Navigate Forward 
Go to the next visited node (web-browser-like navigation)

`e`		Node List :
Show a quick search bar of all nodes in the current project

`*`		Global Node List:
Show a quick search bar of all nodes in all known projects.

(none) 	Jump to Source:
When attempting to type or modify any dynamic node (export, tree, search, etc), the editor will jump to the source node of the text at the cursor's position.

Insertions:

`t` 	Timestamp:
Insert a timestamp at the cursor's location, in the project's default format. For setting timestamp format defaults, see [project_settings](#project_settings)

`i` 	ID:
Insert an arbitrary (unallocated) Node ID with metadata wrapper at the cursor position.

## Sublime Text Interface Tips Sublime Text Interface Tips

Here are some tips for best leveraging Sublime's great UI features.
### Syntax Highlightingyntax Highlighting

This package comes with a .YML file (`sublime_urtext.sublime_syntax`) defining the Urtext syntax, along with two color schemes that provide syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting makes everything easier by showing depth of node nesting and dimming certain elements of the syntax. Select the Sixteen (for light) or Monokai (for dark) color schemes in Preferences -> Color Scheme ... 

Then change to the Urtext syntax by selecting it in View -> Syntax -> Urtext. To avoid having to do this for every file, select View -> Syntax -> Open All with Current Extension As ... -> Urtext. (You can undo this later by repeating the same but selecting Plain Text.)

### Hiding Tabsing Tabs

If you prefer a clean, terminal-like view, hide tabs: View -> Hide Tabs
This preference can also be set on a per-(Sublime)-project basis. See the Sublime documentation.

### Hiding Line Numbersng Line Numbers

For an extra-clean look, hide line numbers by adding:

### Using a Sublime Project for an Urtext Projecte Project for an Urtext Project

( see https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/projects.html )

You don't need to define a Sublime Project for the Urtext Project, but if you intend to do more than one thing at a time in Sublime, it's convenient to have one; you can then use Select Project -> Quick Switch Project (Ctrl-Super-P) to switch among them.

## Making a New ProjectMaking a New Project

An Urtext project is a single folder. The folder must contain at least file with an Urtext Node ID.

To make an new empty project:
- make a new folder and open the folder in Sublime Text. 
- Select Urtext : Initialize Project from the Sublime Command Palette. 
- The folder how has one Urtext file and a `history` folder (for tracking edits. See [File History](#file-history)  for more information)
### Using/Adding Existing FilesUsing/Adding Existing Files

Once a folder contains at least one file with a node ID, you can add and use existing plaintext files in the project without any modification. However for most of the benefits of Urtext you must minimally an ID ([More About Node IDs](#more-about-node-ids)) in each file.

To do so, select `Urtext : Import Project` from the Sublime Command palette.

Note the append will occur without a confirmation dialog, so if you are just experimenting with this system, consider making a copy of your file folder so you can revert without having to manually remove the metadata.

## NodesNodes

A node is region, or set of regions, of a file, up to and including the entire file. A file is itself a node. All nodes can contain other nodes.

The identity of an Urtext node persists no matter its containing filename, even when moved from one file to another. This is accomplished by assigning each node a unique identifier of alphanumeric characters, providing over 46,000 possible nodes per project. It is possible to use files containing no IDs in an Urtext project, but then most of the benefits of Urtext are lost. 

Each node's ID is generated automatically on creation and placed into its initial metadata region. ID's can be changed without affecting functionality, though links must then be manually updated as well. 

Node IDs are assigned in random order and have no special meaning except as a unique identifier. [More About Node IDs](#more-about-node-ids) .
### FilesFiles

The most basic node is a single file. It may or may not contain other nodes nested inside it.

To create a new file, press `Urtext-;`. A new file is created, named and saved automatically. It has whitespace on top and a metadata block at the bottom containing a node ID and (by default) a creation timestamp.
By default, the first non-whitespace line of any node is the node's title. 


### Inline NodesInline Nodes                                                                 

Nodes can be nested arbitrarily deep inside other nodes, whether the parent node is a file or another inline node. The syntax for inline nodes is to wrap the content in double curly braces like this:
#### Example Inline NodeExample Inline Node
Create an inline nodes with `Ctrl-Shift-squiggly-bracker. Inside the inserted double curly braces is a new node with an auto-generated ID. 

To wrap existing content into an inline node, first select the content and use the same keypress.

Like everything in Urtext syntax, you can do this manually by typing the curly braces and generating a new metadata region with an ID by pressing Ctrl-Shift-i. 

Urtext requires attention to syntax. Every opening doubly curly bracket must be closed in the same file and requires an ID metadata tag between its opening an closing brackets.

NOTE that nodes at the file level (see [Files](#files)) do not use curly-braces, as their region boundaries are defined by the file itself.

For all purposes in Urtext, inline nodes' identity is unique from their containing file, parent nodes, and child nodes.
#### Syntax Highlightingyntax Highlighting

When syntax highlighting is used 


( see  | |  ?  >d), inline nodes are colored to showing nesting.

| Compact Nodes >>kpz
### Generating a node ID manuallyGenerating a node ID manually 
If you accidentally delete a Node ID or need to insert one arbitrarily, press Urtext-i.


## MetadataMetadata

Every node can have an unlimited number of metadata entries. Metadata is indexed and becomes searchable and sortable. Other than a few reserved key/value pairs, metadata is user-defined. 

Metadata can be added to text in two ways: using wrapped blocks, or using inline notation:
### WrappedWrapped

Wrapped metadata blocks can be inserted arbitrarily anywhere inside a node. Metadata blocks open with a forward-slash followed by two dashes and close with two dashes followed by a forward slash: 


Wrapped metadata can be either free-form, such as the example above, or structured in colon-separated key/value pairs, with the value (to the right of the colon) containing an optional timestamp. Examples:




Separated multiple entries using either a new line or a semicolon. Using the semicolon option, several entries may be strung together on a single line. 

Note that:

-   A colon separates the key from the value 

-   All three components are optional; any content preceding a colon (if one is present) is interpreted as a key. Content following the (first) colon is interpreted as a value. 

-   If no colon is present, the entry is read as a value with the default key `comment`.

-   A timestamp anywhere in the value will be indexed as the timestamp for the whole metadata entry. If more than on timestamp appears in an entry, only the first one is indexed. iy7
I
### Inlineline

Individual metadata key/value pairs can also be inserted anywhere in the text without a wrapper, using a double colon (` :: `) notation. 


Inline metadata entries remember their location in the text, making them double as contextual markers and sort indexes.

Inline metadata entries do not include the option of timestamps. Instead, you may insert inline timestamp notation. See [Timestamps](#timestamps)

### TimestampsTimestamps                                                                                  

Reliance on the operating system's file-created or file-modified date metadata is avoided, since it can be too easily and involuntarily overwritten under ordinary file system operations, such as copying and moving files or folders. 

Text between two angled brackets () is interpreted as a timestamp. 

To insert a timestamp in Sublime, press Control-Shift-O. 

Node timestamps are part of metadata (see Metadata[Metadata](#metadata)). Urtext also utilizes a "loose" parsing of inline timestamps, meaning they can be placed anywhere and will be recognized and parsed.

Timestamps are read and written utilizing Python's `strftime` directives. The default format is:

%%-PYTHON
`.%a., %b. %d, %Y, %I:%M %p`
%%-END

which creates timestamps like: . The format can be customized in the project_settings node (see project_settings[project_settings](#project_settings)). For more information on `strftime` directives and options, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior.

Time zones are not required in timestamps. If no time zone is present, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is added by default for parsing and comparison purposes. To modify this default, set the `timezone` key in project settings to another valid value. (Timezone List ##### Timezone ListTimezone List

### Reserved Keys Keys

There are two reserved keys that Urtext interprets in a special way:

`index
#### `index`

Provides a way to give nodes a sort order in [The Node Browser](#the-node-browser).  Indexed nodes will sort before (above) the others, lowest numbers appearing first. To utilize, add a two-digit sort index (00-99) to a node, such as: 


You can give the same index number to multiple nodes; in this case they sort first by index, then by timestamped, newest first.

Unindexed nodes will display underneath indexed nodes, by timestamp, newest first.
`flags`
#### `flags`          Used to set node behavior for specific purposes withing Urtext. At present only the following exists:

-   `exclude_f
##### `exclude_from_tree`om_tree`

Excludes a node from being included in a tree. For an example, see Example 2 in "Dynamic Nodes" [Example 2 : Tree](#example-2-:-tree). For more on tree, see [Trees](#trees)
-  `exclude_from

Ctrl-Shift-E 






In Sublime Text there is also the alternative of using the UI dropdown. Press Control-Shift-E or select "Urtext: Node List" from the Sublime command palette (Shift-Super-P). Here you can find a node by typing part of its title.

In the Node List, nodes are sorted by their time of creation, with most recent first. They can also be sorted by index (see [`index`](#`index`)).

lection / Timeline View ## Collection / Timeline ViewCollection / Timeline View 


Urtext will parse node timestamps along with inline timestamps into a project timeline. Press Ctrl-Shift-T or select Urtext: Show Timeline in the Sublime command palette. Each node and inline timestamp is shown in chronological order with nearby text. You can try it with this example project, but note that since many nodes in this document are undated, they have a default date of Thu., Jan. 01, 1970, 12:00AM.

As everywhere in a project, node IDs shown are links that can be opened using Ctrl-Shift-/.

## TreesTrees

In Sublime, you can view a tree of node hierarchies in two ways:
### From any given nodeFrom any given node

Position the cursor in the node you want to see as root (outermost) and select "Urtext: Show Tree From Current Node" from the Sublime Command Palette. This will add a new split view to the left side of the current view in Sublime, containing a tree with the selected node as root.
### From the rootrom the root

Position the cursor anywhere in the node/file and select "Urtext: Show Tree From Root". This will do the same as above, but the tree will include everything back to the node's root. If the tree extends upward beyond the current file, that will also be included.
Note that each branch of the resulting file tree contains Node ID that works like a link. You can navigate the links on the tree using Shift-Control-/ (see [Links](#links)) or using [Traverse Mode](#traverse-mode).

File trees are displayed in Sublime's scratch views, meaning they will never report as being "dirty" (unsaved). They are intended for one-time/temporary use, will not have a filename, and will not update when a node/file changes. To make permanent and dynamically updated trees, see [ MISSING LINK : e82 ] .

You can extend node trees beyond the file level by using [Pointers](#pointers).

Thanks to the `anytree` module (https://pypi.org/project/anytree/) for the plaintext node tree diagrams.

## Links and PointersLinks and Pointers
### Links Links 

To make a "hyperlink" from one node to another, use the right angle bracket (>) followed immediately by a node ID. Linking does not require a filename or any other information, only the node ID. Any other surrounding text is ignored.
#### Sublime Text tools to help with linkingSublime Text tools to help with linking 


Two Sublime Command Palette commands can make linking quick and easy:

Urtext : Link To ...
Links from the currently viewed node to another node which you can select in the selection panel. When you select a node in the quick panel, a link to that node will be inserted at the cursor.

Urtext: Link From ...
Links TO the current node FROM another node. When you select this command, a link to the current node will be copied to the clipboard. You can then paste the reference into the node you open in the quick panel.
Dy
### Dynamically Titled Linksamically Titled Links

Prepending a pipe character to any node link will populate the space between the pipe and link with the node's title, from its metadata or default title. Examples are found throughout this documentation. 

Note that node link titles are not updated globally throughout the project whenever any node's title changes; rather, titled links are updated at the single file level whenever that file is saved.
eni
### Opening Linksg Links 

Sublim
#### Sublime

Press Shift-Ctrl-/ on a line containing a link to open the node with the linked ID. If the link is to an inline node, Sublime will scroll to and center its starting point.
ythonis
#### Pythonistaa 

Use the `>` key when the cursor is on any line containing a link.





Not
that Urtext reads node regions on every save, so cursor location may be imprecise if the file has been altered since the last save.

Linked Relationships ### Viewing Linked RelationshipsViewing Linked Relationships

Elaborate writing and reference systems such as wikis often linking nodes together in tangled and intricate ways. While Urtext cannot draw diagrams of this kind (called acyclic graphs) in plaintext, it can represent these relationships from the perspective of any one node: Position the cursor in the desired node and select "Urtext : Show Linked Relationships..." The currently selected node will be displayed as root; all nodes linking into this nodes, and recursively into those nodes, will be displayed above the root; all files linked from this node, and recursively from those nodes, will be displayed below. Circular references are represented up to one iteration.

These diagrams are displayed as Sublime "scratch" views, meaning they will never report as being dirty (unsaved). They are intended for one-time/temporary use and will not update when a node/file changes. To make permanent and dynamically updated diagrams, see [ MISSING LINK : e82 ] .

### PointersPointers          

You can extend trees beyond the file level to create node relationships spanning many files. Preceding a link to a node with two right angle brackets instead of one creates a Pointer. In addition to being a hyperlink, this connects the targeted node, and all of its subchildren, as children of the node containing the Pointer. Example:

Here is an example Child Node:

##### Example Child Node Using a Node PointerExample Child Node Using a Node Pointer

Pointers          

You can extend trees beyond the file level to create node relationships spanning many files. Preceding a link to a node with two right angle brackets instead of one creates a Pointer. In addition to being a hyperlink, this connects the targeted node, and all of its subchildren, as children of the node containing the Pointer. Example:

Here is an example Child Node:

 

The example Pointer above becomes a child of this node, visible in the [ MISSING LINK : 01a ]  or using the other tree views described in [Trees](#trees).

The advantages to Node Pointers are many, including:

- The tree represents a hierachy of actual content, rather than the files containing the content.

- The tree permits nesting both within and beyond file level.

- The tree can be displayed from any arbitrary starting point, whether or not its branches are within or beyond a particular file.
#### Duplicate PointersDuplicate Pointers 

Node Pointers may point more than once to the same node, so that content can be reused or referenced across multiple trees within the same project:

Here is the same example child node from above: 
#### Recursive Node Pointersecursive Node Pointers

Recursive Node Pointers would be ones that point to one of their containing node's own ancestors, causing a circular reference.

These are not prohibited, but the recursion will not be drawn if it is already contained in the tree. Instead, the point of recursion will show RECURSION, with a link to the Node ID of the node causing the recursion.

For example, this Node Pointer points back to the root node of the table of contents: | Urtext  Version: 0.4.0-alpha  Usage Guide and References >>a5m. Instead of the table of contents being drawn recursively from this node, you can see the recursion point in the table of contents.

Note, however, that if you view the entire tree with another node as root, one full iteration will still appear, with the point of recursion falling elsewhere in the tree. For instance, below is the table of contents with the node "Pointers" ([Pointers](#pointers)) as root. See Dynamic Nodes ([ MISSING LINK : e82 ] ) for more information on how to generate trees like this in dynamic nodes.

### Traverse ModeTraverse Mode   




This feature is currently implemented in Sublime Text only.

You can navigate a node tree or list of nodes by turning on Traverse mode (Shift-Ctrl-R). This will open another pane next to the one you are currently in. As you navigate the nodeview in the left side with the cursor or mouse, the selected node shows on the right. Use Sublime's Focus Group navigation keys, or the mouse, to switch between left and right panes.

Toggle Traverse Mode off by pressing Shift-Ctrl-R again. The status bar at the bottom of the Sublime window indicates whether Traverse is on or off. 

Note that if Traverse mode is off, you can also open a link manually (Shift-Ctrl-/) as normal. 

This feature is not built into Urtext; it is a feature of the Sublime package only.
#### Word Wrap in Traverse ModeWord Wrap in Traverse Mode

Since Traverse Mode splits the window into two or more panes, it is suggested to set Word Wrap Column to "Auto" in Sublime Settings. This will cause the edited views to wrap correctly no matter the screen or window/pane size, as well as in Sublime's Distraction Free Mode.

Whenever Traverse Mode is enabled on a view, word wrap for that view is turned off altogether to prevent awkward wrapping of trees. It is restored when Traverse Mode is turned off.


## Using Multiple Projects at a TimeUsing Multiple Projects at a Time

To use multiple projects at once, there is a project context manager. When you initially pass a path to Urtext, it looks recursively in all sub folders for additional projects. If it finds a compilable Urtext project in any one, it adds these to the context manager.  You can then freely switch among projects, either explicitly, or using links between the projects (described below). When switching projects, all Urtext's features, content and behavior, including links, compiling, and all functions linked to UI buttons, will operate in the context of the selected project. 

You can put all your Urtext projects into sub folders of a single path. Alternatively, you may put them anyplace in the file system and choose as your Urtext root a folder that encompasses them all. Compiling may take longer if Urtext has to search through many unused directories. 

Using Python, it is possible to only instantiate a single project, without the context manager. The current implementations in Sublime and Pythonista, however, use the context manager by default, even if you are only using a single project.

Recall that what defines a project is a folder. This is also what separates it from other projects. If you add other Urtext project folders into the initial path, they will all be accessible from the same project list.

To switch between projects in Sublime, select Urtext: Select Project from the command palette.
In Pythonista, use "Switch Projects" from the feature menu.
### Project Naming (Identification)Project Naming (Identification)

Unlike nodes, projects are uniquely identified by name. For this reason, each project must have an unique name within the running instance of Urtext. Projects can be named using the project_title key in the project's project_settings node. If no name is present, the project's name becomes its absolute path in the file system.
L
### Linking Between Projectsnking Between Projects

You may also link from one project to another within the text. To so this, use the following syntax:

"na
dj
(This link is only an example and is non-functioning)

Following this link will change the project context to the named project and open its specified node.

## Converting and ExportingConverting and Exporting

Urtext can convert (export) nodes, and sets of nodes, to plaintext, Markdown and HTML. Results can be either output to a file or written back into another node within the same project. Like other dynamic functions, exporting is dynamic ; that is, when changes are made to the source nodes, exports are immediately updated, whether they are in a project node or an external file.

Exporting is not implemented in user-interface menus/buttons. Instead, export by utilizing dynamic definitions.

The export command has three components:

export : (format) : ( source_node_id )

(format) : One of `plaintext`, `markdown` or `html`
(source_id): The source node to export.
### Example : Urtext Documentation Exported in Markdown to a File Example : Urtext Documentation Exported in Markdown to a File

The following dynamic definition exports this entire documentation (from its root node [Urtext  Version: 0.4.0-alpha  Usage Guide and References](#urtext--version:-0.4.0-alpha--usage-guide-and-references) ) in Markdown format to a file called documentation.md:
### Example : Fragment Exported to HTMLxample : Fragment Exported to HTML

The following Dynamic Definition exports the [Links and Pointers](#links-and-pointers) section of the documentation to HTML, into a node inside this one:

#### Search Using Dynamic Nodesarch Using Dynamic Nodes

Search results can populate a dynamic node by using the key-value pair:

- search:(string)

## Filenames
Filenames                                                                                 

Since node identities are independent of their containing filenames, you can use any naming convention you want. Urtext can also rename files automatically in convenient formats based on their title and/or index. Renaming by index is useful, for instance, if you want file-level nodes easily readable inside a file system, mobile app, or other file browser.

To rename a file, select "Rename File from Meta" from the command palette (Command-P). This will rename the file in one of the following schema:

If an index is present:

.txt

If no index is present:

.txt

This system preserves automatic numerical sorting within the filesystem, such that the most recent un-indexed nodes appear first. If you want to use another system, such as putting the title first, you can do so.

### Make Installation Easier Make Installation Easier

The way Sublime Text is currently set up, manually installing all the dependency modules is the easiest way to get it set up. Alternatives such as using git subtrees, wrapping each individual dependency in a separate Sublime Package and then making those Packages dependencies of the Urtext Package, etc., all end up involving both more maintenance and more legwork for the end user than just manually installing everything.

If any developer can suggest a better solution, please submit a pull request.

## File HistoryFile History

Urtext files, being in plaintext, can be versioned using tools such as Git, Subversion, Mercurial, and others. Those tools are intended mainly for coding, when it is generally considered bad practice to commit non-working/non-compiling iterations of a project. Though Urtext files do compile, their actual text content is not a factor in this, so is reasonable to track changes at all stages of a project, even at granular levels.

Though use of powerful version control tools is not discouraged, Urtext has its own, lighter versioning system that tracks edits in the background at discrete intervals so it is not necessary to make explicit "commits" to have access to file history. Urtext creates a single, linear, nondestructive history of each file's content, with each snapshot being a "diff", or record of changes since the previous snapshot. When a previous state is restored, no "checkout" or "rewind" occurs; rather, the newly restored state is appended to the end of the history. Therefore, in addition to functioning as version control, the feature can also be used as a non-destructive "undo/redo" editing history that saves state after the file is closed.

The default interval is 10 seconds, and can be modified in project_settings. 
To access a file's timeline, use Control-Shift-G in Sublime Text. 

Histories are stored in the /history folder inside the project, as .pkl ("pickle") files. This folder requires no user involvement. If using another version control tool such as Git, you may wish to add the /history folder to your .gitignore file, so that only explicitly committed versions of your project are visible in distributed repositories.
