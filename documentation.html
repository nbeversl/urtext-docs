<h1>About This Documentation</h1>
 
  
  This is a documentation of Urtext, written in Urtext. If you're reading it as a `README.MD` (on Github, etc.), it was compiled from the text files in this repository. Clone or download the respository to use it as both a reference and an example project. 

  This documentation is in active development. It may be incomplete or behind features and functionality of Urtext. Edits and revisions are encouraged in the form of issues and pull requests (https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext-docs/pulls, https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext-docs/issues).

  Many of the examples rely on syntax, formatting, and highlighting, which is stripped out in export to Markdown. Where necessary these are replaced with linked screenshots as necessary (see <a href="#00q">Linking to Files and Other Resources</a> and <a href="#ezg">Exporting</a>)

  Inside an Urtext implementation, such as the Sublime Text with the Urtext package, you can navigate the project directly. Most of the key commands utilize Control-Shift as the modifier. 
  - Control-Shift-/ to follow any link
  - Control-Shift-h at any time to return to this "home" node.  <div class="urtext_line"><h1>About This Documentation</h1></div>

<h1>About Urtext</h1>


    <div class="urtext_line"><h1>About Urtext</h1></div>
<h2>Description</h2>
 
        
        Urtext is a syntax and interpreter for plaintext. Urtext's basic unit is a "node", which is a range or set of ranges of text within a file. A folder of nodes is called a "project". The Urtext interpreter is aware of all the nodes in a project at once, so that nodes can reference, modify, and organize one another, across hundreds or thousands of files. The <a href="#znj">Basic Syntax</a> permits embedding of structural and instructional code into the text itself. 
     
        The present interpreter for Urtext is in Python and can be used wherever Python 3.3 or later runs. Equivalent or variant interpreters could be created in any language or editing environment. 

        Urtext has no built-in user interface; it only compiles and manages the files. Using Urtext in a text editor requires an additional wrapper to pass messages between the text editor and Urtext. Currently there is a package for Sublime Text (Mac/Windows/Linux) and a script for Pythonista (iOS).   <div class="urtext_line"><h2>Description</h2></div>

    <h2>Comparison To Other Tools</h2>
 
        
        Urtext shares some characteristics with markup languages such as Markdown and LaTeX, with the important difference that it is author-facing, rather than reader-facing. Though it can be made to export to HTML, Urtext is not primarily a document conversion or document generation tool. It is rather a tool for writing, connecting and organizing text.
    
        Urtext consolidates content, structure and instructions (scripting) into a single compilable syntax. Although it can link documents or parts of documents together, unlike HTML, there is no additional code or markup "behind" the visible syntax. Everything the interpreter reads is visible to the user. <div class="urtext_line"><h2>Comparison To Other Tools</h2></div>

    <h2>Requirements and Features</h2>
   

        Many of the following features and benefits were core requirements when creating Urtext. Others came about indirectly. Though many can be found in other tools, they are not currently found together in one single existing tool; this was the motivation for creating Urtext.

            - It uses plain text files. Plaintext is fast, human-readable, flexible, cross-platform, device-portable, and future-proof.

            - It is usable across multiple platforms and devices.
 
            - Cascading complexity; use only the parts you need. Does not take months/years to learn.

            - Being open source, Urtext is extensible, hackable and customizable to specific needs.

            - It can compile, organize, and link content spread across hundreds or thousands of files. Files and content elements can be linked to one another in tree-like, recursive (tangled), and other non-hierarchical ways.

            - It has customizable and extensible metadata that does not rely on the file system.

            - It is decoupled from any particular text editor or interface ; it can be incorporated into any environment that runs Python, including any scriptable text editor or Python-scriptable environment capable of displaying a text editing view.
               
            - It can incorporate (embed) other plaintext syntaxes, including other markup languages and other programming language syntaxes.
   
            - There is no need to interact directly with the file system (creating, naming, saving, organizing files). File creation, naming and management is handled for you.
      
            - Future-proof. No reliance on anything that may not exist in 5 or 1000 years. Urtext files themselves are in plaintext, which is future-proof. The interpreter/compiler could be implemented in any sufficiently capable language desired, current, past or future.
   
            - Does not depend on a cloud service. Though cloud services can be used to sync project files among devices, the interpreter itself is made to operate locally; content wholly resides on the device being used.

            Being in plaintext and having a syntax specification, it can also be used with:

            - Themes and syntax highlighting.
            - Version control (Git, for example).    <div class="urtext_line"><h2>Requirements and Features</h2></div>

<h1>Quick Start, Guides and Examples</h1>
  

  <h2>Installation and Setup (Desktop)</h2>


For desktop use (PC/Mac/Linux) Urtext is implemented in Sublime Text.

1. Download Sublime Text. (https://www.sublimetext.com/).

2. Download Urtext and all its dependencies from the monorepo at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. You can either download this repository as a .ZIP file and unzip it, or if you want to maintain version control, use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. Put the contents of the cloned/unzipped folder (important: not the folder itself) directly into your `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3` folder.

3. Download the Sublime Urtext package at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_sublime`. Place it in your Packages folder (Sublime Text 3/Packages)

4. Clone/download this documentation repository and open its folder in Sublime. It will automatically be read as an Urtext project.

Once the Sublime package is installed, it will always look for any files with the .txt extension in open folders and attempt to compile them into a project. To open an existing Urtext project, open the folder, a file in the folder, or a Sublime project that includes the folder, and any feature described in this documentation will work.

To make a new project, open an empty folder and select Select `Urtext : Initialize Project` from the Sublime Command Palette. For more information, see <a href="#dce">Projects</a>.

`{  }` 
Inline Node Wrappers. Can appear anywhere. Can be nested aribrarily deep.
More information: <a href="#004">Inline Nodes</a>

`>`		
Node Link. Links to the specified node by ID, like a hyperlink. 
More information: <a href="#0y2">Links</a>

`>>`		
Node Pointer: Embeds the specified node as though it were included inline using wrappers { } (see above)
More information: <a href="#lmu">Pointers</a>

`|` 
Title Pipe. Placed immediately before a node link or node pointer (whitespace is ok), dynamically populates the linked node title.
Example and more info: <a href="#4vu">Dynamic Titles</a>

`^`
Compact Node marker. Must be the first non-whitespace character on a line. Must include an ID in order to parse.
More information: <a href="#j6t">Compact Nodes</a>

`< >`
Timestamp wrapper. Parses user-defined datetime strings, with many default formats built in.
The first character inside the brackets may not be `!`, '-', or whitespace.
Example: 
More information: <a href="#005">Syntax and Format</a>

`::`
Metadata assignment operator. Accepts a user-defined key on the left, and values and timestamps on the right.
Metadata may appear anywhere in text. They attach to their containing (parent) node but also remember their location and can serve as anchors/bookmarks to their context. Keys must be single words (underscore permitted), values may be any characters, terminated with a semicolon or newline. The pipe character (`|`) separates multiple values for a single key.

  <h2>Dynamic Definitions : Syntax and Parameters</h2>


Dynamic definitions contain instructions for dynamically building nodes from the contents of other nodes. They can be written anywhere; it is not necessary to store the definition in the same file to which it refers. (Note that they cannot, however, be stored in the node they target, since they would overwrite themselves.)

Dynamic definitions are wrapped using double left and right square brackets. Note that there are no restrictions on spacing, indentation, newlines, or inclusion of other arbitrary text or whitespace. Dynamic definitions ignore whitespace and arbitrary text outside of defined parameters. The order of parameters within a definition is unimportant; they are evaluated as a group.

The dynamic definition below does not actually do anything. It rather lists every parameter along with an explanation of its use and purpose. For example uses, see <a href="#k8p">Dynamic Nodes</a>

<div class="urtext_line">Here are some tips for best leveraging Sublime's great UI features while using Urtext.</div>
<h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3>
 

		The Sublime Text package includes a syntax definition file in YML format (`sublime_urtext.sublime_syntax`), along with two color schemes that provide syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting makes everything easier by showing depth of node nesting and dimming certain elements of the syntax. Select the Sixteen (for light) or Monokai (for dark) color schemes in Preferences -> Color Scheme ... 

		Then change to the Urtext syntax by selecting it in View -> Syntax -> Urtext. To avoid having to do this for every file, select View -> Syntax -> Open All with Current Extension As ... -> Urtext. (This can be undone by repeating the same but selecting Plain Text.)  <div class="urtext_line"><h3>Syntax Highlighting</h3></div>

	<h3>Hiding Tabs</h3>
	

		If you prefer a spare, terminal-like view, hide tabs: View -> Hide Tabs.
		This preference can also be set on a per-(Sublime)-project basis. See the Sublime documentation.  <div class="urtext_line"><h3>Hiding Tabs</h3></div>

	<h3>Hiding Line Numbers</h3>
  

			For an extra-clean look, hide line numbers by adding:
				
				```
				
				"settings" : {
					 "line_numbers": false,
				},
				
				```

			... to your Sublime project settings file.

	<h3>Disable Prompts for File Reload</h3>
 

		 Urtext does a lot of writing to files on the fly, often when they are already open. To avoid seeing a dialog every time, add add the following to your Sublime project settings or User Preferences file:
				 ```
				 "settings" : {
					"always_prompt_for_file_reload": false,
				},

  <h2>Projects</h2>


An Urtext project is a single folder. The folder must contain at least file with an Urtext Node ID.

To make an new empty project:
	- make a new folder and open the folder in Sublime Text. 
	- Select Urtext : Initialize Project from the Sublime Command Palette. 
	- The folder how has one Urtext file and a `history` folder for tracking edits. (See <a href="#prp">History</a> )

<h3>Using/Adding Existing Files</h3>
 

	Once a folder contains at least one file with a node ID, you can add and use existing plaintext files in the project without any modification. However for most of the benefits of Urtext you must minimally an ID (<a href="#01q">Node IDs</a>) in each file.
	
	To do so, select `Urtext : Import Project` from the Sublime Command palette.

    Note the append will occur without a confirmation dialog, so if you are just experimenting with this system, consider making a copy of your file folder so you can revert without having to manually remove the metadata.

  <h2>Nodes</h2>


A node is region, or set of regions, of a file, up to and including the entire file. A file is itself a node. All nodes can contain other nodes.

The identity of an Urtext node persists no matter its containing filename. This is accomplished by assigning each node a unique identifier of alphanumeric characters, providing over 46,000 possible nodes per project. 

Urtext generates IDs automatically on creation of new nodes. ID's can be changed without affecting functionality, though links must then be manually updated as well. 

It is possible to use files containing no IDs in an Urtext project, but then most of the features of Urtext are lost.


Node IDs are assigned in random order and have no special meaning except as a unique identifier. For more information see <a href="#01q">Node IDs</a>.

<h3>Types of Nodes</h3>
  
  	<h4>File Nodes</h4>


The most basic node is a single file. It may or may not contain other nodes nested inside it.

To create a new file-level node: <a href="#ve3">New Node: `ctrl + shift + ;`</a>. A new file is created, named and saved automatically. It has whitespace on top and a metadata block at the bottom containing a node ID and (by default) a creation timestamp.

  	<h4>Inline Nodes</h4>
                                                                 
	 
The syntax for inline nodes is to wrap the content in curly braces:

  <div class="urtext_line"><h4>Inline Nodes</h4></div>
<div class="urtext_line">The syntax for inline nodes is to wrap the content in curly braces:</div>
<h5>Example Inline Node</h5>
   <div class="urtext_line"><h5>Example Inline Node</h5></div>
</div>

Create an inline nodes with <a href="#rzx">Insert Inline Node: `ctrl + shift + [`</a>. Inside the inserted double curly braces is a new node with an auto-generated ID.   

To wrap existing content into an inline node, first select the content and use the same keypress.

Nodes can be nested arbitrarily deep inside other nodes, whether the parent node is a file or another inline node. When syntax highlighting is active, inline node wrappers are tinted to showing nesting level:

Note that every opening doubly curly bracket must be closed in the same file and requires an ID between its opening and closing brackets. The examples above use <a href="#2a3">Trailing Node IDs</a>. You can also use regular <a href="#00x">Metadata</a> as at the bottom of this file.

Note that nodes at the file level (<a href="#ekz">File Nodes</a>) do not use curly-braces, as their region boundaries are defined by the file itself.

For all purposes in Urtext, inline nodes' identity is unique from their containing file, parent nodes, and child nodes.

	<h4>Compact Nodes</h4>


Key: <a href="#1qq">Insert Compact Node: `ctrl + shift + ^`</a>

For text content requiring only a single line, such as list items, very short notes and similar, use the caret character (`^`) as the first non-whitesoace character on a new line. This defines a new node as a child of the node in which the ^ character appears, with the closing wrapper being the end of the same line. 

Like all nodes, a compact node requires an ID. Like all nodes, it can contain metadata and even inline nodes, as long as the entire contents, including wrappers and metadata, are contained on a single line. (Note that "line" in this case refers to consecutive characters between explicit line breaks, and not to lines in the editor, which may be arbitrarily wrapped.)

<h3>Node IDs</h3>


The purpose of Node IDs is to uniquely identify each node in a project.

Nodes IDs are three characters long and incorporate all ten digits (0 - 9) and all letters a - z, resulting in over 46,000 possible unique identifiers per project.

Node IDs are generated automatically by Urtext; every newly created node is assigned an available unused ID as a metadata entry:

	 <- This is not just an example; it specifies the ID of this node.

f>./files/example-node-id.png

Note that the node ID entry can appear anywhere in a node. If you want to keep node ID's out of the way, such as at the end or beginning of each node, or separate from the rest of your metadata, this will not affect their functionality.

<h4>Trailing Node IDs</h4>
  

	To keep IDs even more out of sight, they can also be specified as the last three characters of a node, without a key or a double-colon syntax. Syntax highlighting will then shade them to appear unobtrusive. This convention is used throughout most of this documentation. This only works for nodes wrapped in brackets, not for compact or file nodes.

	Note that trailing node IDs must be preceded by a space.  

	Key: <a href="#9zp">Insert Inline Node, minimal: `ctrl + shift + p` (OSX), `alt  + shift + p` (Windows, Linux)</a>

IDs have no special meaning, do not represent the order of node creation within a project, and are not related to or "hashed from" node content. They are assigned in random order so the probability of accidentally creating two nodes with the same ID is minimal when using the project across many devices that may not always be in sync.

When an ID is deleted from a project, new nodes are later assigned to vacant node IDs.

<h3>Node IDs</h3> can also be user-created arbitrarily if for some reason you want to. If you do this, note that node IDs are case-insensitive.

If more than one Node ID appears in a node, only the first one is used as the Node's ID; the rest are treated (indexed) as regular metadata.

<h4>Duplicate Node IDs</h4>
 	

	If two nodes end up with the same ID, only one (the first one found) will be assigned the ID. The entire second file containing the node with the duplicate ID will contain a warning message. See <a href="#bpk">Errors and Warnings</a>

	To correct the problem, it is necessary to manually change the duplicate ID to a new one. To ensure the corrected node ID is unique, it is recommended to use <a href="#gv9">Add Node ID: `ctrl + shift + i`</a> for this (as described above), after the rest of the project is compiled.

  <h2>Metadata</h2>


<div class="urtext_line"><h2>Metadata</h2></div>
<h3>General Syntax</h3>
 

  Every node can have an unlimited number of metadata entries. Metadata is structured in double-colon-separated key/value pairs, with the value (to the right of the colon) containing an optional timestamp. Examples:

        
        

  Metadata gets indexed and becomes searchable and sortable from anywhere within the project. Metadata entries also "remember" their location, allowing them to serve as contextual markers or "bookmarks". 

  Other than a few reserved key/value pairs, metadata is user-defined. Keys must be single words, though characters such as dash and underscore are allowed. Values may include spaces. Terminate metadata entries using either a new line or a semicolon. Using the semicolon option, several entries may be strung together on a single line:

       
      
  Note that a timestamp anywhere in the value will be indexed as the timestamp for the whole metadata entry. If more than on timestamp appears in an entry, only the first one is indexed. <div class="urtext_line"><h3>General Syntax</h3></div>

  <div class="urtext_line"><h3>Timestamps</h3></div>
<h4>Syntax and Format</h4>
   

      Text between two angled brackets (`<  >`) is parsed as a timestamp whenever the first character inside the brackets is not `!`, `-` or whitespace. Urtext uses the Python `dateutil` module to loosely parse dates in almost any format. For instance, all of the following are valid:

            
            
            
            
            ... and so on

      Press <a href="#7b8">Insert Timestamp: `ctrl + shift + t`</a> to insert the current date and time anywhere. The format of the resulting timestamp is set in project_gettings using the <a href="#00n">`timestamp_format`</a> key.

      Timestamps are one of three elements of metadata (see )
      Urtext also utilizes a "loose" parsing of inline timestamps, meaning they can be placed anywhere and will be recognized and parsed. <div class="urtext_line"><h4>Syntax and Format</h4></div>

  <h4>Tracking Node Dates and Times</h4>
    

      Reliance on the operating system's "created" or "modified" date metadata is avoided, since these values can be inadvertently overwritten during ordinary file system operations. Instead, new nodes receive by default a "timestamp" metadata key when created: <div class="urtext_line"><h4>Tracking Node Dates and Times</h4></div>

  <h4>Time Zones</h4>
     

      Time zones are not required. If no time zone is present, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is added by default  for parsing and comparison purposes. To modify this default, set the <a href="#boe">For a list of all timezones</a>  key in project_settings to another valid value.  <div class="urtext_line"><h4>Time Zones</h4></div>

  <h2>Dynamic Nodes</h2>


Dynamic nodes contain content aggregated from the contents of other nodes. Dynamic content stays up to date with its source content "dynamically" (on file save). A dynamic node can be seen as a "view into" other content. 

Dynamic nodes are created using a Dynamic Definition. Dynamic Definitions are specified with double square brackets , and have there own syntax, including scoping and highlighting. Dynamic definitions can query, sort, filter, and format the output of nodes in a variety of ways, making them adaptable to many purposes. This section illustrates some example uses of dynamic nodes. It will be helpful to reference <a href="#87g">Dynamic Definitions : Syntax and Parameters</a>.

Dynamic Definitions can be written anywhere; it is not necessary to store the definition in the same file to which it refers. (Note that they cannot, however, be stored in the node they target, since they would overwrite themselves.)

<a href="#jsc">Insert Dynamic Definition with Node: `ctrl + shift + ]`</a> creates a new dynamic definition in Sublime, auto-populated with a corresponding empty inline node. You can also write a definition manually, providing the ID of an existing node. For example, if you want the contents to replace an existing node, assign this key the value of that node's ID. If you want it to populate new inline node, create that node and then copy/paste its ID. Note that Dynamic Definitions do not create their target nodes automatically ; the target node must exist, or the definition will have no effect.

There are two main kinds of dynamic output, Lists and Collections:

"Lists" are lists of nodes, with each node displayed not more than once. Lists can optionally expand into trees, showing the hierarchy of nested relationships from each root node in the list.

"Collections" aggregate metadata entries with their context; the same node may appear many times in a collection if it contains many metadata entries matching the queried parameters.

	<h3>Collections</h3>


Collections "collect" metadata entries. 

Metadata entries remember their position in their node and so can be used as anchors or "bookmarks". There are no "prescribed" uses for this functionality; metadata entries could be used in any given project as anchors only, metadata only, or in combination.

For instance, metadata could be used to insert 

Collections return links that include the exact character location of each metadata entry. This is 

Another use would be to collect all metadata entries of a given key, and optionally a given value, into a single view.

<h4>Sublime Text tools to help with linking</h4>
   
        

        Two Sublime Command Palette commands can make linking quick and easy:
     
        Urtext : Link To ...
            Links from the currently viewed node to another node which you can select in the selection panel. When you select a node in the quick panel, a link to that node will be inserted at the cursor.
 
        Urtext: Link From ...
            Links TO the current node FROM another node. When you select this command, a link to the current node will be copied to the clipboard. You can then paste the reference into the node you open in the quick panel.

<h3>Dynamic Titles</h3>
  

    Prepending a pipe character to any node link will populate the space between the pipe and link with the node's title, from its metadata or default title. Examples are found throughout this documentation. Titled links are updated at the single file level whenever the file is saved.  <div class="urtext_line"><h3>Dynamic Titles</h3></div>

<h3>Pointers</h3>
          

By preceding a link to a node with two right angle brackets instead of one, you can extend trees beyond the file level to create node relationships spanning many files. In addition to being a hyperlink, this connects the targeted node, and all of its subchildren, as descendants of the node containing the Pointer:

    <h5>Example Child Node Using a Node Pointer</h5>


<div class="urtext_line"><h5>Example Child Node Using a Node Pointer</h5></div>
</div> 

The example Pointer above becomes a child of this node, visible in the <a href="#e5j">Table of Contents</a> or using the other tree views described in <a href="#w8u">Trees</a>.

The advantages to Node Pointers include:
    - The tree represents a hierachy of actual content, rather than the files containing the content.
    - The tree permits nesting both within and beyond file level.
    - The tree can be displayed from any arbitrary starting point, whether or not its branches are within or beyond a particular file.

<h4>Duplicate Pointers</h4>
  
    
    Node Pointers may point more than once to the same node, so that content can be reused or referenced across multiple trees within the same project.
    Here is the same example child node from above:  
    Note that it appears twice in the Table of Contents, once as a child of this node and once as a child of this node's parent node ( <a href="#lmu">Pointers</a>).

</div>

<h4>Recursive Node Pointers</h4>
  

    If the tree of a Node Pointer includes one of its own ancestors, the tree will stop at the recursion point with the indication `! RECURSION -` before the node title and link. For example, this Node Pointer points to the parent of this node (<a href="#6ct">Recursive Node Pointers</a>),  | Pointers >>lmu. You can see the recursion point in the table of contents.

    Note that if you view the tree with another node selected as root, one full iteration will still appear, with the point of recursion falling elsewhere. The tree below is turned "inside out", with <a href="#lmu">Pointers</a> as root. 
       
        
        (See <a href="#w8u">Trees</a> for how to generate trees like this in dynamic nodes.)

  <h2>File Naming</h2>
                                                                                

Since node identities are independent of their filenames, you can use any naming convention you want. Urtext can also rename files automatically in convenient formats based on their title and/or index. Renaming by index is useful, for instance, if you want file-level nodes easily readable inside a file system, mobile app, or other file browser.

To rename a file, select "Rename File from Meta" from the command palette (Command-P). This will rename the file in one of the following schema:

If an index is present:

     .txt

If no index is present:

     .txt

This system preserves automatic numerical sorting within the filesystem, such that the most recent un-indexed nodes appear first. If you want to use another system, such as putting the title first, you can do so.

  <h2>History</h2>


Though use of powerful version control tools (such as Git, Mercurial, etc.) is possible, Urtext has a lighter built-in versioning system that tracks edits at intervals. It is not necessary to make explicit "commits" in order to utilize this. Urtext creates a single, linear history of each file's content, with each snapshot being a "diff", or record of changes, since the previous snapshot. When a previous state is restored, no "checkout" or "rewind" occurs; rather, the newly restored state is appended to the history. Therefore, in addition to functioning as version control, the feature can also be used as an infinite and non-destructive "undo/redo" editing history that saves state when the file is closed. The default interval is 10 seconds, and can be modified in project_settings. 

To access a file's history, use <a href="#ndc">Toggle History Traverse: `ctrl + shift + g`</a>.

Histories are stored in the /history folder inside the project, as .pkl ("pickle") files. This folder requires no user involvement. If using another version control tool such as Git, you may wish to add the /history folder to your .gitignore file, so that only explicitly committed versions of your project are visible in distributed repositories.

The `project_settings` node is optional. To create one, make a node and use metadata to give it the title `project_settings`:

This is the `project_settings` node for the "Urtext Documentation" Urtext project. In the metadata for this node you can specify a handful of settings for the project. (The text content of the node does not matter.)

  <h2>Using Multiple Projects</h2>


To use multiple projects at once, there is a project context manager. When you initially pass a path to Urtext, it looks recursively in all sub folders for additional projects. If it finds a compilable Urtext project in any one, it adds these to the context manager.  You can then freely switch among projects, either explicitly, or using links between the projects (described below). When switching projects, all Urtext's features, content and behavior, including links, compiling, and all functions linked to UI buttons, will operate in the context of the selected project. 

You can put all your Urtext projects into sub folders of a single path. Alternatively, you may put them anyplace in the file system and choose as your Urtext root a folder that encompasses them all. Compiling may take longer if Urtext has to search through many unused directories. 

Using Python, it is possible to only instantiate a single project, without the context manager. The current implementations in Sublime and Pythonista, however, use the context manager by default, even if you are only using a single project.

Recall that what defines a project is a folder. This is also what separates it from other projects. If you add other Urtext project folders into the initial path, they will all be accessible from the same project list.

To switch between projects in Sublime, select Urtext: Select Project from the command palette.
In Pythonista, use "Switch Projects" from the feature menu.

<h3>Project Naming (Identification)</h3>
 

Unlike nodes, projects are uniquely identified by name. For this reason, each project must have an unique name within the running instance of Urtext. Projects can be named using the project_title key in the project's project_settings node. If no name is present, the project's name becomes its absolute path in the file system.

	You may also link from one project to another within the text. To so this, use the following syntax:
	
	=>"name or path of the other project[ MISSING LINK : idj ] 
       (This link is only an example and is non-functioning)

	Following this link will change the project context to the named project and open its specified node.

Opening the Node List

Ctrl-Shift-E 






In Sublime Text there is also the alternative of using the UI dropdown. Press Control-Shift-E or select "Urtext: Node List" from the Sublime command palette (Shift-Super-P). Here you can find a node by typing part of its title.

In the Node List, nodes are sorted by their time of creation, with most recent first. They can also be sorted by index (see <a href="#00z">`index`</a>).

<h3>Traverse Mode</h3>
Traverse Mode   




This feature is currently implemented in Sublime Text only.

    You can navigate a node tree or list of nodes by turning on Traverse mode (Shift-Ctrl-R). This will open another pane next to the one you are currently in. As you navigate the nodeview in the left side with the cursor or mouse, the selected node shows on the right. Use Sublime's Focus Group navigation keys, or the mouse, to switch between left and right panes.
    
    Toggle Traverse Mode off by pressing Shift-Ctrl-R again. The status bar at the bottom of the Sublime window indicates whether Traverse is on or off. 

    Note that if Traverse mode is off, you can also open a link manually (Shift-Ctrl-/) as normal. 

    This feature is not built into Urtext; it is a feature of the Sublime package only.

<h4>Word Wrap in Traverse Mode</h4>
 

        Since Traverse Mode splits the window into two or more panes, it is suggested to set Word Wrap Column to "Auto" in Sublime Settings. This will cause the edited views to wrap correctly no matter the screen or window/pane size, as well as in Sublime's Distraction Free Mode.

        Whenever Traverse Mode is enabled on a view, word wrap for that view is turned off altogether to prevent awkward wrapping of trees. It is restored when Traverse Mode is turned off.
