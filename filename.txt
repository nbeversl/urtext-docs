Compact Nodes

	For nodes that can fit on a single line, such as items in a list, short phrases, word definitions, and so on, you can use a simplified node syntax. Begin the line with the caret symbol (^); the closing wrapper then becomes the next newline (the end of the same line). Like other nodes:
require an ID
can have arbitrary other metadata
become child nodes of their containing node.

Remove Indent Guides  

			Formatting plaintext using tab indentions can look messy if indent guides are on. To turn them off, add to your Sublime project settings file:
			%%-JSON
			 "settings" : 
				"draw_indent_guides": false,
			
			%%-END-JSON

Trailing Node IDs

Creating a Dynamic Node 

        Ctrl-Shift-] creates a new dynamic definition in Sublime.
        In Pythonista or other editors, create them manually.

Files 
        
		Links to files can be made by writing f> , followed immediately with a file path relative to the folder of the project:
		Example:   f>./README.md

Generating a node ID manually 
If you accidentally delete a Node ID or need to insert one arbitrarily, press Urtext-i.

Dynamically Titled Links  

    Prepending a pipe character to any node link will populate the space between the pipe and link with the node's title, from its metadata or default title. Examples are found throughout this documentation. 

    Titled links are updated at the single file level whenever that file is saved.

In-Progress / Experimental / Wish List
iPhone/iPad/iOS  
	
	Urtext can run on iOS using Pythonista. While it does not provide the elegant UI of Sublime Text, it can be set up to meet the project criteria described in[ MISSING LINK : 008 ] , including the requirement that the content wholly reside on every device and not depend on an internet connection.

	Pythonista can import and manipulate files directly in iCloud Drive. However, iCloud Drive does not always sync folder changes in the background, and/or syncs the file list without syncing full file contents. This makes it necessary to open the iOS Files app in order manually trigger a sync before using the Urtext project. In the event one or more files is missing or different among devices, these differences will propogate to dynamic nodes with wrong, stale, or missing information. When this occurs many times, file version conflicts develop.

	A cleaner solution using Dropbox is possible using the Synchronator module (https://github.com/markhamilton1/Synchronator). This module provides a route to automate explicit bidirectional syncing directly between Dropbox and Pythonista environment on demand, such as whenever the project is being used. The module is complicated to install.
Synchronator Setup   

		DOCUMENTATION COMING
Syncing manually comes with the drawback that changes made on the iOS device will not themselves sync to Dropbox in the background. For instance, if changes are made to a file on iOS while not connected to the internet and Pythonista, the project will have to be explictly synced at a later time. So there remains the possibility that projects will get out of sync.

Tracking Node Dates and Times    

      Reliance on the operating system's "created" or "modified" date metadata is avoided entirely in Urtext, since these values can be easily and inadvertently overwritten during ordinary file system operations, such as copying and moving files/folders. Instead, new nodes  receive by default a "timestamp" metadata key when created:

Project Naming (Identification) 

Unlike nodes, projects are uniquely identified by name. For this reason, each project must have an unique name within the running instance of Urtext. Projects can be named using the project_title key in the project's project_settings node. If no name is present, the project's name becomes its absolute path in the file system.

Requirements and Features   

        Many of the following features and benefits were core requirements when creating Urtext. Others came about indirectly. Though many can be found in other tools, they are not currently found together in one single existing tool; this was the motivation for creating Urtext.

            - It uses plain text files. Plaintext is fast, human-readable, flexible, cross-platform, device-portable, and future-proof.

            - It is usable across multiple platforms and devices.
 
            - Cascading complexity; use only the parts you need. Does not take months/years to learn.

            - Being open source, Urtext is extensible, hackable and customizable to specific needs.

            - It can compile, organize, and link content spread across hundreds or thousands of files. Files and content elements can be linked to one another in tree-like, recursive (tangled), and other non-hierarchical ways.

            - It has customizable and extensible metadata that does not rely on the file system.

            - It is decoupled from any particular text editor or interface ; it can be incorporated into any environment that runs Python, including any scriptable text editor or Python-scriptable environment capable of displaying a text editing view.
               
            - It can incorporate (embed) other plaintext syntaxes, including other markup languages and other programming language syntaxes.
   
            - There is no need to interact directly with the file system (creating, naming, saving, organizing files). File creation, naming and management is handled for you.
      
            - Future-proof. No reliance on anything that may not exist in 5 or 1000 years. Urtext files themselves are in plaintext, which is future-proof. The interpreter/compiler could be implemented in any sufficiently capable language desired, current, past or future.
   
            - Does not depend on a cloud service. Though cloud services can be used to sync project files among devices, the interpreter itself is made to operate locally; content wholly resides on the device being used.

            Being in plaintext and having a syntax specification, it can also be used with:

            - Themes and syntax highlighting.
            - Version control (Git, for example).

**example::todo
         Note that it doesn't matter where in the "parent" node the metadata entry appears. Metadata entries can be placed anywhere in a node, with the same effect.
       
        yoc

Example 1 : List    

    Here are four inline nodes with example tags and indexes:
Example Source Node 1
Example Source Node 3
Example Source Node 2
Example Source Node 4
( Note that each of these nodes has the `exclude_from_tree` flag in the metadata, so that they are not included in the Table of Contents. See"`exclude_from_tree`". )

    Here is an example dynamic node definition targeting node ID[ MISSING LINK : 016 ] 

        [ MISSING LINK : 016 ] 

        Here is the compiled node defined by the definition above. Changing the dynamic definition and/or the contents or metadata of the source nodes will update the dynamic node. Saving is necessary to trigger the update.

Collections

Collections are for "collecting" metadata entries, along with their context, in order to gain a range of views into the text content of a project. A common use for this would be to create a timeline from datetimestamps. Another use would be to collect all metadata entries of a given key, and optionally a given value, into a single view.

Sublime 

        Press Shift-Ctrl-/ on a line containing a link to open the node with the linked ID. If the link is to an inline node, Sublime will scroll to and center its starting point.

Using Urtext in iOS with Pythonista
 
Urtext can be run on iOS devices using Pythonista, which provides a full Python interpreter inside of iOS. It is available in the iOS App Store.

This implementation utilizes the native iOS user interface to create a basic text editor view, along with buttons bound to Urtext's functions (similar to the keyboard shortcut bindings in Sublime), project navigation funtions, and syntax highlighting matching those found in the Sublime Text implementation. Using iCloud, projects can be synced among iOS devices and other devices (desktops, laptops). Once synced, a copy of the project resides fully on the device and is not dependent on a live data connection (see "Requirements and Features").

To set it up:

    - Install Pythonista (http://omz-software.com/pythonista/)

    - Clone or download the Urtext-Pythonista package (https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_pythonista).

    - Install all the Python dependencies into your Pythonista environment. The requirements are the same as for Sublime Text ("Dependencies and Installation" )

    - (optional) To enabling launching or switching to Urtext using an app icon, use the Shortcuts app.

Syntax 

  Every node can have an unlimited number of metadata entries. Metadata gets indexed and becomes searchable and sortable from anywhere within the project. Metadata entries also "remember" their location in the text, making them operate as contextual markers. Other than a few reserved key/value pairs, metadata keynames and values are user-defined.  

  Metadata is structured in double-colon-separated key/value pairs, with the value (to the right of the colon) containing an optional timestamp. Examples:

        
        

  Keys must be single words, with characters such as dash and underscore allowed. Values may include spaces. Terminate metadata entries using either a new line or a semicolon to separate them from other text or other metadata entries. Using the semicolon, several entries may be strung together on a single line:

       
      
  Note that a timestamp anywhere in the value will be indexed as the timestamp for the whole metadata entry. If more than on timestamp appears in an entry, only the first one is indexed.

About Urtext
Description 
        
        Urtext is a syntax and interpreter for plaintext. Urtext's basic unit is a "node", which is a range or set of ranges of text within a file. A folder of nodes is called a "project". The Urtext interpreter is aware of all the nodes in a project at once, so that nodes can reference, modify, and organize one another, across hundreds or thousands of files. The "Syntax Quick-Reference" permits embedding of structural and instructional code into the text itself. 
     
        The present interpreter for Urtext is in Python and can be used wherever Python 3.3 or later runs. Equivalent or variant interpreters could be created in any language or editing environment. 

        Urtext has no built-in user interface; it only compiles and manages the files. Using Urtext in a text editor requires an additional wrapper to pass messages between the text editor and Urtext. Currently there is a package for Sublime Text (Mac/Windows/Linux) and a script for Pythonista (iOS).
Comparison To Other Tools 
        
        Urtext shares some characteristics with markup languages such as Markdown and LaTeX, with the important difference that it is author-facing, rather than reader-facing. Though it can be made to export to HTML, Urtext is not primarily a document conversion or document generation tool. It is rather a tool for writing, connecting and organizing text.
    
        Urtext consolidates content, structure and instructions (scripting) into a single compilable syntax. Although it can link documents or parts of documents together, unlike HTML, there is no additional code or markup "behind" the visible syntax. Everything the interpreter reads is visible to the user at all times.
Uses  
        
        Urtext has many uses, including but limited to:    
            - prose writing
            - research
            - documentation
            - knowledge/information base
            - journaling
            - Zettelkasten
            - project/personal organization
            - notetaking
            - lightweight database
            - any other writing or information management that can be done in text form
Requirements and Features   

        Many of the following features and benefits were core requirements when creating Urtext. Others came about indirectly. Though many can be found in other tools, they are not currently found together in one single existing tool; this was the motivation for creating Urtext.

            - It uses plain text files. Plaintext is fast, human-readable, flexible, cross-platform, device-portable, and future-proof.

            - It is usable across multiple platforms and devices.
 
            - Cascading complexity; use only the parts you need. Does not take months/years to learn.

            - Being open source, Urtext is extensible, hackable and customizable to specific needs.

            - It can compile, organize, and link content spread across hundreds or thousands of files. Files and content elements can be linked to one another in tree-like, recursive (tangled), and other non-hierarchical ways.

            - It has customizable and extensible metadata that does not rely on the file system.

            - It is decoupled from any particular text editor or interface ; it can be incorporated into any environment that runs Python, including any scriptable text editor or Python-scriptable environment capable of displaying a text editing view.
               
            - It can incorporate (embed) other plaintext syntaxes, including other markup languages and other programming language syntaxes.
   
            - There is no need to interact directly with the file system (creating, naming, saving, organizing files). File creation, naming and management is handled for you.
      
            - Future-proof. No reliance on anything that may not exist in 5 or 1000 years. Urtext files themselves are in plaintext, which is future-proof. The interpreter/compiler could be implemented in any sufficiently capable language desired, current, past or future.
   
            - Does not depend on a cloud service. Though cloud services can be used to sync project files among devices, the interpreter itself is made to operate locally; content wholly resides on the device being used.

            Being in plaintext and having a syntax specification, it can also be used with:

            - Themes and syntax highlighting.
            - Version control (Git, for example).

Quick Start, Guides and Examples  
Installation and Setup (Desktop)

For desktop use (PC/Mac/Linux) Urtext is implemented in Sublime Text.

1. Download Sublime Text. (https://www.sublimetext.com/).

2. Download Urtext and all its dependencies from the monorepo at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. You can either download this repository as a .ZIP file and unzip it, or if you want to maintain version control, use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. Put the contents of the cloned/unzipped folder (important: not the folder itself) directly into your `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3` folder.

3. Download the Sublime Urtext package at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_sublime`. Place it in your Packages folder (Sublime Text 3/Packages)

4. Clone/download this documentation repository and open its folder in Sublime. It will automatically be read as an Urtext project.

Once the Sublime package is installed, it will always look for any files with the .txt extension in open folders and attempt to compile them into a project. To open an existing Urtext project, open the folder, a file in the folder, or a Sublime project that includes the folder, and any feature described in this documentation will work.

To make a new project, open an empty folder and select Select `Urtext : Initialize Project` from the Sublime Command Palette. For more information, see "Projects".

Basic Syntax 

	%%-DOC (<- This "pass marker" causes the Urtext compiler to ignore all Urtext syntax between here and the closing (END) marker, 
	for documentation purposes. For details see "Pass Markers and Embedded Syntaxes")

	
	All text is plain content unless inside a timetamp wrapper or dynamic definition wrapper. 
	The following syntax applies:

	{  }	Subnode	wrappers. Can appear anywhere. Can be nested aribrarily deep.
			More information: "Inline Nodes"

	 >		Link to another node by ID. 
	 		More information: "Links"

	 | 		Placed before a node link, dynamically populates the linked node title.

	 ^		Compact Node marker. Must be the first non-whitespace character on a line. id::83g
	 		More information: "Compact Nodes"
		
	>>		Node Pointer
	 		Embeds the specified node as though it were included inline using wrappers { } (see above)
	 		More information: "Pointers"

	< > 	Timestamp enclosure. Parses user-defined datetime strings, with some default formats built in.
			Example: <Tue., Jul. 28, 2020, 07:43 PM>
			More information: "Timestamps"

	::		Metadata assignment operator. Accepts a user-defined key on the left, and values and timestamps on the right.
			Metadata may appear anywhere in text.
			Keys must be single words (underscore permitted), values may be any characters, terminated with a semicolon or newline.
			Example: example_key::example value for the key <Tue., Jul. 28, 2020, 73:39 PM>;
			
			The pipe character (`|`) separates multiple values.
			Example: some_key::one value | another value

			Metadata entries are attached in a general way to their containing (parent) node but also remember their 
			location and can serve as an anchor to their immediate context.
			More information: "Metadata"
	
			Trailing node ID:
			The last three characters of a node, if they are preceded by whitespace, can serve as the `id` metadata
			value of that node, to make them less obtrusive while reading/editing text.
			
			%%-END-DOC 

			( The following is a trailing node ID that closes the node titled "Basic Syntax" --> ) 
		
		flags::keep_syntax; 33j
Built-in Metadata Keys  

	There are some built-in metadata keys. Built-in keys begin with an underscore character `_`.

	_title  				Overrides the Node Title

	_flags  				Sets node behavior. More info:"`_flags`"

	A few additional keys are reserved, but only for nodes containing project settings. See "project_settings".

Dynamic Definitions Quick-Reference

Dynamic definitions contain instructions for dynamically building nodes from the contents of other nodes. They can be written anywhere; it is not necessary to store the definition in the same file to which it refers. (Note that they cannot, however, be stored in the node they target, since they would overwrite themselves.)

Dynamic definitions are wrapped using double left and right square brackets:


%%-DOC

	Dynamic Definition Wrapper
		
	Note the dynamic definitions ignore whitespace and arbitrary text outside of functions.
	The order of functions within a definition is unimportant; they are evaluated as a group.
	
	  

%%-END-DOC

Operations

Built-in operations are bound to either hotkeys or to UI menus.

Hotkeys differ among operating systems and can be reassigned according to your preference by

Node Access History

Sublime Text Interface Tips  
	
	Here are some tips for best leveraging Sublime's great UI features.
Syntax Highlighting 

		This package comes with a .YML file (`sublime_urtext.sublime_syntax`) defining the Urtext syntax, along with two color schemes that provide syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting makes everything easier by showing depth of node nesting and dimming certain elements of the syntax. Select the Sixteen (for light) or Monokai (for dark) color schemes in Preferences -> Color Scheme ... 

		Then change to the Urtext syntax by selecting it in View -> Syntax -> Urtext. To avoid having to do this for every file, select View -> Syntax -> Open All with Current Extension As ... -> Urtext. (You can undo this later by repeating the same but selecting Plain Text.)
Hiding Tabs	

			If you prefer a clean, terminal-like view, hide tabs: View -> Hide Tabs
			This preference can also be set on a per-(Sublime)-project basis. See the Sublime documentation.
Hiding Line Numbers  

			For an extra-clean look, hide line numbers by adding:
				
				%%-JSON
				
				"settings" : 
					 "line_numbers": false,
				,
				
				%%-END-JSON

			... to your Sublime project settings file. (Ignore the JSON syntax pass makers above beginning with `%%`
			See "Pass Markers and Embedded Syntaxes" )
Full Screen / Distraction Free Mode  

			Since you can navigate entirely from within files, Urtext works great in Sublime's Distraction Free Mode. View -> Enter Distraction Free Mode.
Disable Prompts for File Reload 

			 Urtext does a lot of writing to files on the fly, often when they are already open. To avoid seeing a dialog every time, add add the following to your Sublime project settings or User Preferences file:
				 %%-JSON
				 "settings" : 
					"always_prompt_for_file_reload": false,
				,
				%%-END-JSON
Remove Indent Guides  

			Formatting plaintext using tab indentions can look messy if indent guides are on. To turn them off, add to your Sublime project settings file:
			%%-JSON
			 "settings" : 
				"draw_indent_guides": false,
			
			%%-END-JSON
Save on Focus Lost  

			Urtext recompiles your project every time a file changes. To make this more automatic, addto your Sublime settings file:
			%%-JSON
			 "save_on_focus_lost": true 
			%%-END-JSON
Using a Sublime Project for an Urtext Project  
	
			( see https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/projects.html )

			You don't need to define a Sublime Project for the Urtext Project, but if you intend to do more than one thing at a time in Sublime, it's convenient to have one; you can then use Select Project -> Quick Switch Project (Ctrl-Super-P) to switch among them.

Reference 	
	Projects

An Urtext project is a single folder. The folder must contain at least file with an Urtext Node ID.

To make an new empty project:
	- make a new folder and open the folder in Sublime Text. 
	- Select Urtext : Initialize Project from the Sublime Command Palette. 
	- The folder how has one Urtext file and a `history` folder (for tracking edits. See "File History" )
Using/Adding Existing Files 

	Once a folder contains at least one file with a node ID, you can add and use existing plaintext files in the project without any modification. However for most of the benefits of Urtext you must minimally an ID ("Node IDs") in each file.
	
	To do so, select `Urtext : Import Project` from the Sublime Command palette.

    Note the append will occur without a confirmation dialog, so if you are just experimenting with this system, consider making a copy of your file folder so you can revert without having to manually remove the metadata.

"Using Multiple Projects at a Time"

	Nodes

A node is region, or set of regions, of a file, up to and including the entire file. A file is itself a node. All nodes can contain other nodes.

The identity of an Urtext node persists no matter its containing filename. This is accomplished by assigning each node a unique identifier of alphanumeric characters, providing over 46,000 possible nodes per project. (It is possible to use files containing no IDs in an Urtext project, but then most of the features of Urtext are lost.)

Urtext generates IDs automatically on creation of new nodes. ID's can be changed without affecting functionality, though links must then be manually updated as well. 

Node IDs are assigned in random order and have no special meaning except as a unique identifier. "Node IDs".
 
Types of nodes:

	File Nodes

The most basic node is a single file. It may or may not contain other nodes nested inside it.

To create a new file, press `Urtext-;`. A new file is created, named and saved automatically. It has whitespace on top and a metadata block at the bottom containing a node ID and (by default) a creation timestamp.

	Inline Nodes                                                                 
	 
The syntax for inline nodes is to wrap the content in curly braces:

  {
Example Inline Node   id::00e
Create an inline nodes with `Ctrl-Shift-squiggly-brace. Inside the inserted double curly braces is a new node with an auto-generated ID.   

To wrap existing content into an inline node, first select the content and use the same keypress.

Nodes can be nested arbitrarily deep inside other nodes, whether the parent node is a file or another inline node. When syntax highlighting is active, inline node wrappers are tinted to showing nesting level:
    
    `
    {
Example first level   
        {
second level  
            {
third level 
                {
fourth level  
                    {
fifth level     
                    5pq
80d
6qj
8fv
y9t
`

Note that every opening doubly curly bracket must be closed in the same file and requires an ID between its opening and closing brackets. The examples above use "Trailing Node IDs". You can also use regular "Metadata" as at the bottom of this file.

Note that nodes at the file level ("File Nodes") do not use curly-braces, as their region boundaries are defined by the file itself.

For all purposes in Urtext, inline nodes' identity is unique from their containing file, parent nodes, and child nodes.

	Compact Nodes

For text content requiring only a single line, such as list items, very short notes and similar, use the caret character (`^`) as the first non-whitesoace character on a new line. This defines a new node as a child of the node in which the ^ character appears, with the closing wrapper being the end of the same line. 

Like all nodes, a compact node requires an ID. Like all nodes, it can contain metadata and even inline nodes, as long as the entire contents, including wrappers and metadata, are contained on a single line. (Note that "line" in this case refers to consecutive characters between explicit line breaks, and not to lines in the editor, which may be arbitrarily wrapped.)
Example Compact Node
Example inline node within the compact node.

Node Titles 

	By default, the first non-whitespace line of any node is the node's title.
Node IDs

The purpose of Node IDs is to uniquely identify each piece of content (node) in a project.

Nodes IDs are three characters long and incorporate all ten digits (0 - 9) and all letters a - z, resulting in over 46,000 possible unique identifiers per project.

Node IDs are generated automatically by Urtext; every newly created node is assigned an available unused ID. 

IDs have no special meaning, do not represent the order of node creation within a project, and are not related to or "hashed from" node content in any way. They are assigned in random order so the probability of accidentally creating two nodes with the same ID is minimal when using the project across many devices that may not always be in sync.

When an ID is deleted from a project, new nodes are later assigned to vacant node IDs.
Inserting a Node ID manually 

	Control-Shift-I will insert a new and unused node anywhere in the project, in case you delete one or want to insert one manually.
Node IDs can also be user-created arbitrarily if for some reason you want to. If you do this, note that node IDs are case-insensitive.

If more than one Node ID appears in a node, only the first one is used as the Node's ID; the rest are treated (indexed) as regular metadata.
Accidental Duplicate Node IDs 	

	If two nodes end up with the same ID, only one (the first one found) will be assigned the ID. The entire second FILE containing the node with the duplicate ID is omitted. The log will show a message to this effect. 

	To correct the problem, it is necessary to manually change the duplicate ID to a new one. To ensure the corrected node ID is unique, it is recommended to use control-shift-I for this (as described above), after the rest of the project is compiled.
Generating a node ID manually 
If you accidentally delete a Node ID or need to insert one arbitrarily, press Urtext-i.



	Metadata
Syntax 

  Every node can have an unlimited number of metadata entries. Metadata gets indexed and becomes searchable and sortable from anywhere within the project. Metadata entries also "remember" their location in the text, making them operate as contextual markers. Other than a few reserved key/value pairs, metadata keynames and values are user-defined.  

  Metadata is structured in double-colon-separated key/value pairs, with the value (to the right of the colon) containing an optional timestamp. Examples:

        
        

  Keys must be single words, with characters such as dash and underscore allowed. Values may include spaces. Terminate metadata entries using either a new line or a semicolon to separate them from other text or other metadata entries. Using the semicolon, several entries may be strung together on a single line:

       
      
  Note that a timestamp anywhere in the value will be indexed as the timestamp for the whole metadata entry. If more than on timestamp appears in an entry, only the first one is indexed.
Applying Metadata to Children and Descendants  

  
  To apply metadata to all immediate children of a node, precede the key name immediately with an asterisk (`*`):
*example::todo
  
          {
This node will have the value `todo` for the `example` key.     ucs
{
So will this one.    fna
Note that the asterisk applies the tag ONLY to the children. To apply the tag also to the outer node, give it a separate entry without an asterisk.
 
      pxp
To apply metadata to all descendants of a node recursively, precede the key name immediately with two asterisks:
{
This node will have the value `todo` for the `example` key.  
          {
So will this one  
            {
And this one.    eq5
ep2
6r4
**example::todo
         Note that it doesn't matter where in the "parent" node the metadata entry appears. Metadata entries can be placed anywhere in a node, with the same effect.
       
        yoc
Timestamps
Syntax and Format   

      Text between two angled brackets () is parsed as a timestamp.  To insert the current date and time anywhere, press Control-Shift-t: 

      Timestamps are read and written utilizing Python's `strftime` directives. The following formats are included by default:

          %%-PYTHON # (<- for info about this marker see "Pass Markers and Embedded Syntaxes" )
`         # Sat., Sep. 12, 2020, 09:35 AM
          '%a., %b. %d, %Y, %I:%M %p'           
          # September 12, 2020
          '%B %-d, %Y' 
          # September 2020
          '%B %Y'
          # 09-12-2020
          '%m-%d-%Y'
          # Sat., Sep. 12, 2020, 09:35 AM '
          '%a., %b. %d, %Y, %I:%M %p %z' 
          # Sat., Sep. 12, 2020, 09:35 AM'
          '%a., %b. %d, %Y, %I:%M %p'
          # Saturday, September 12, 2020, 09:35 AM'
          '%A, %B %d, %Y, %I:%M %p'
          # 'September 12, 2020, 09:35 AM'
          '%B %d, %Y, %I:%M %p'
          # 'September 12, 2020, 09:35AM'
          '%B %d, %Y, %I:%M%p'
          # 2020
          '%Y'
          # September 12, 2020'
          '%B %d, %Y'
          # Saturday, September 12, 2020, 09:35AM
          '%A, %B %d, %Y, %I:%M%p'
`
      %%-END-PYTHON 

      Additional formats can be added in the "project_settings" node.
Node timestamps are part of metadata (see "Metadata"). 
      Urtext also utilizes a "loose" parsing of inline timestamps, meaning they can be placed anywhere and will be recognized and parsed.
Tracking Node Dates and Times    

      Reliance on the operating system's "created" or "modified" date metadata is avoided entirely in Urtext, since these values can be easily and inadvertently overwritten during ordinary file system operations, such as copying and moving files/folders. Instead, new nodes  receive by default a "timestamp" metadata key when created:
Time Zones 	  

  	Time zones are not required. If no time zone is present, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is added by default  for parsing and comparison purposes. To modify this default, set the `timezone` key in "project_settings" to another valid value.
Case-sensitivity  

      -   Values are not case-sensitive, except those with the following keys:

          `title`             Manually overrides the node's title. 

          The rest are used only in the project_settings node (see "project_settings") :

          `timestamp_format`  
          `filenames`         
          `project_title`
          `timezone`
          `timestamp_format`
Reserved Keys 

      There are two reserved keys that Urtext interprets in a special way:
`index`   
    
         Provides a way to give nodes a sort order in "The Node Browser".  Indexed nodes will sort before (above) the others, lowest numbers appearing first. To utilize, add a two-digit sort index (00-99) to a node, such as:  
         You can give the same index number to multiple nodes; in this case they sort first by index, then by timestamped, newest first.

         Unindexed nodes will display underneath indexed nodes, by timestamp, newest first.
`_flags`  

           Used to set node behavior for specific purposes withing Urtext. At present only the following exists:
`exclude_from_tree`  

               Excludes a node from being included in a tree. For an example, see Example 2 in "Dynamic Nodes" "Example 2 : Tree". For more on tree, see [ MISSING LINK : 00h ]
`exclude_from_export` 

                Excludes a node from being exported, when project content is exported. See "Exporting".


Dynamic Nodes

Dynamic definitions contain instructions for dynamically building nodes from the contents of other nodes. Dynamic content remains up to date with its source content at all times. Dynamic definitions contain instructions for dynamically building nodes from the contents of other nodes. They can be written anywhere; it is not necessary to store the definition in the same file to which it refers. (Note that they cannot, however, be stored in the node they target, since they would overwrite themselves.)

The complete parameters and syntax are here : "Dynamic Definitions Quick-Reference"

This section illustrates more generally the use and purpose of dynamic nodes, with examples.

There are two main kinds of dynamic output: lists and collections: "Lists" are exactly that: lists of nodes, with each node displayed not more than once once. Lists can optionally expand into trees, showing the hierarchy of nested relationships from each root node in the list. Collections, on the other hand, show metadata entries with their context; the same node may appear many times in a colelction if it contains many metadata entries matching the queried parameters.

Urtext will parse node timestamps along with inline timestamps into a project timeline. Press Ctrl-Shift-T or select Urtext: Show Timeline in the Sublime command palette. Each node and inline timestamp is shown in chronological order with nearby text. You can try it with this example project, but note that since many nodes in this document are undated, they have a default date of Thu., Jan. 01, 1970, 12:00AM.

As everywhere in a project, node IDs shown are links that can be opened using Ctrl-Shift-/.



You can extend node trees beyond the file level by using "Pointers".

Thanks to the `anytree` module (https://pypi.org/project/anytree/) for the plaintext node tree diagrams.
Collections

Collections are for "collecting" metadata entries, along with their context, in order to gain a range of views into the text content of a project. A common use for this would be to create a timeline from datetimestamps. Another use would be to collect all metadata entries of a given key, and optionally a given value, into a single view.


	
	| Links and Pointers Links and Pointers
Links   

    To make a "hyperlink" from one node to another, use the right angle bracket (>) followed immediately by a node ID. Linking does not require a filename or any other information, only the node ID. Any other surrounding text is ignored.
Sublime Text tools to help with linking   
        

        Two Sublime Command Palette commands can make linking quick and easy:
     
        Urtext : Link To ...
            Links from the currently viewed node to another node which you can select in the selection panel. When you select a node in the quick panel, a link to that node will be inserted at the cursor.
 
        Urtext: Link From ...
            Links TO the current node FROM another node. When you select this command, a link to the current node will be copied to the clipboard. You can then paste the reference into the node you open in the quick panel.
Dynamically Titled Links  

    Prepending a pipe character to any node link will populate the space between the pipe and link with the node's title, from its metadata or default title. Examples are found throughout this documentation. 

    Titled links are updated at the single file level whenever that file is saved.
Opening Links
Sublime 

        Press Shift-Ctrl-/ on a line containing a link to open the node with the linked ID. If the link is to an inline node, Sublime will scroll to and center its starting point.
Pythonista  

        Use the `/` key when the cursor is on any line containing a link.
Note that Urtext reads node regions on every save, so cursor location may be imprecise if the file has been altered since the last save.
Linking to outside resources
Web / HTTP(S) 

        HTTP(S) links are recognized automatically and will open in the default browser.    
        Example: pressing Ctrl/Command-Shift-/ on this line below will open the link: http://github.com
Files 
        
		Links to files can be made by writing f> , followed immediately with a file path relative to the folder of the project:
		Example:   f>./README.md

Pointers          

By preceding a link to a node with two right angle brackets instead of one, you can extend trees beyond the file level to create node relationships spanning many files. In addition to being a hyperlink, this connects the targeted node, and all of its subchildren, as descendants of the node containing the Pointer:

    Example Child Node Using a Node Pointer
 

The example Pointer above becomes a child of this node, visible in the "Table of Contents" or using the other tree views described in [ MISSING LINK : 00h ] .

The advantages to Node Pointers are many, including:

    - The tree represents a hierachy of actual content, rather than the files containing the content.

    - The tree permits nesting both within and beyond file level.

    - The tree can be displayed from any arbitrary starting point, whether or not its branches are within or beyond a particular file.
Duplicate Pointers  
    
    Node Pointers may point more than once to the same node, so that content can be reused or referenced across multiple trees within the same project:
    
    Here is the same example child node from above: 
Recursive Node Pointers  

    If the tree of a Node Pointer includes to one of its own ancestors, the recursion will not be drawn again if it is already contained in the tree. Instead, the point of recursion will incidate "RECURSION", with a link to the Node ID of the node causing the recursion.

    For example, this Node Pointer points back to the root node of the table of contents: 
        | Urtext  Version: 0.5-alpha  Usage Guide and References >>a5m. 
    Instead of the table of contents being drawn recursively from this node, you can see the recursion point in the table of contents.

    Note that if you view the entire tree with another node selected as root, one full iteration will still appear, with the point of recursion falling elsewhere in the tree. Below is the Table of Contents with "Pointers" as root.
Example Recursive Node Tree           
          Pointers"Pointers"
See "Dynamic Definitions Quick-Reference" for more information on how to generate trees like this in dynamic nodes.

	Exporting

    Urtext can convert (export) nodes, and sets of nodes, to plaintext, Markdown and HTML. Results can be either output to a file or written back into another node within the same project. Like other dynamic functions, exporting is dynamic ; that is, when changes are made to the source nodes, exports are immediately updated, whether they are in a project node or an external file.

    Exporting is not implemented in user-interface menus/buttons. Instead, export by utilizing dynamic definitions.

    The export command has three components:

    	export : (format) : ( source_node_id )

        (format) : One of `plaintext`, `markdown` or `html`
        (source_id): The source node to export.
Example : Urtext Documentation Exported in Markdown to a File  

    The following dynamic definition exports this entire documentation (from its root node "Urtext  Version: 0.5-alpha  Usage Guide and References" ) in Markdown format to a file called documentation.md:
Example : Fragment Exported to HTML  

    The following Dynamic Definition exports the "Links and Pointers" section of the documentation to HTML, into a node inside this one:
 defined

	Filenames
                                                                                 

Since node identities are independent of their containing filenames, you can use any naming convention you want. Urtext can also rename files automatically in convenient formats based on their title and/or index. Renaming by index is useful, for instance, if you want file-level nodes easily readable inside a file system, mobile app, or other file browser.

To rename a file, select "Rename File from Meta" from the command palette (Command-P). This will rename the file in one of the following schema:

If an index is present:

     .txt

If no index is present:

     .txt

This system preserves automatic numerical sorting within the filesystem, such that the most recent un-indexed nodes appear first. If you want to use another system, such as putting the title first, you can do so.

	Development
Make Installation Easier  
	
	The way Sublime Text is currently set up, manually installing all the dependency modules is the easiest way to get it set up. Alternatives such as using git subtrees, wrapping each individual dependency in a separate Sublime Package and then making those Packages dependencies of the Urtext Package, etc., all end up involving both more maintenance and more legwork for the end user than just manually installing everything.

	If any developer can suggest a better solution, please submit a pull request.

	File History

Urtext files, being in plaintext, can be versioned using tools such as Git, Subversion, Mercurial, and others. Those tools are intended mainly for coding, when it is generally considered bad practice to commit non-working/non-compiling iterations of a project. Though Urtext files do compile, their actual text content is not a factor in this, so is reasonable to track changes at all stages of a project, even at granular levels.

Though use of powerful version control tools is not discouraged, Urtext has its own, lighter versioning system that tracks edits in the background at discrete intervals so it is not necessary to make explicit "commits" to have access to file history. Urtext creates a single, linear, nondestructive history of each file's content, with each snapshot being a "diff", or record of changes since the previous snapshot. When a previous state is restored, no "checkout" or "rewind" occurs; rather, the newly restored state is appended to the end of the history. Therefore, in addition to functioning as version control, the feature can also be used as a non-destructive "undo/redo" editing history that saves state after the file is closed.

The default interval is 10 seconds, and can be modified in project_settings. 
To access a file's timeline, use Control-Shift-G in Sublime Text. 

Histories are stored in the /history folder inside the project, as .pkl ("pickle") files. This folder requires no user involvement. If using another version control tool such as Git, you may wish to add the /history folder to your .gitignore file, so that only explicitly committed versions of your project are visible in distributed repositories.

	Using Multiple Projects at a Time

To use multiple projects at once, there is a project context manager. When you initially pass a path to Urtext, it looks recursively in all sub folders for additional projects. If it finds a compilable Urtext project in any one, it adds these to the context manager.  You can then freely switch among projects, either explicitly, or using links between the projects (described below). When switching projects, all Urtext's features, content and behavior, including links, compiling, and all functions linked to UI buttons, will operate in the context of the selected project. 

You can put all your Urtext projects into sub folders of a single path. Alternatively, you may put them anyplace in the file system and choose as your Urtext root a folder that encompasses them all. Compiling may take longer if Urtext has to search through many unused directories. 

Using Python, it is possible to only instantiate a single project, without the context manager. The current implementations in Sublime and Pythonista, however, use the context manager by default, even if you are only using a single project.

Recall that what defines a project is a folder. This is also what separates it from other projects. If you add other Urtext project folders into the initial path, they will all be accessible from the same project list.

To switch between projects in Sublime, select Urtext: Select Project from the command palette.
In Pythonista, use "Switch Projects" from the feature menu.
Project Naming (Identification) 

Unlike nodes, projects are uniquely identified by name. For this reason, each project must have an unique name within the running instance of Urtext. Projects can be named using the project_title key in the project's project_settings node. If no name is present, the project's name becomes its absolute path in the file system.
Linking Between Projects 

	You may also link from one project to another within the text. To so this, use the following syntax:
	
	=>"name or path of the other project[ MISSING LINK : idj ] 
       (This link is only an example and is non-functioning)

	Following this link will change the project context to the named project and open its specified node.

User Interface Elements  
The Node Browser

Opening the Node List

Ctrl-Shift-E 






In Sublime Text there is also the alternative of using the UI dropdown. Press Control-Shift-E or select "Urtext: Node List" from the Sublime command palette (Shift-Super-P). Here you can find a node by typing part of its title.

In the Node List, nodes are sorted by their time of creation, with most recent first. They can also be sorted by index (see "`index`").

Traverse ModeTraverse Mode   




This feature is currently implemented in Sublime Text only.

    You can navigate a node tree or list of nodes by turning on Traverse mode (Shift-Ctrl-R). This will open another pane next to the one you are currently in. As you navigate the nodeview in the left side with the cursor or mouse, the selected node shows on the right. Use Sublime's Focus Group navigation keys, or the mouse, to switch between left and right panes.
    
    Toggle Traverse Mode off by pressing Shift-Ctrl-R again. The status bar at the bottom of the Sublime window indicates whether Traverse is on or off. 

    Note that if Traverse mode is off, you can also open a link manually (Shift-Ctrl-/) as normal. 

    This feature is not built into Urtext; it is a feature of the Sublime package only.
Word Wrap in Traverse Mode 

        Since Traverse Mode splits the window into two or more panes, it is suggested to set Word Wrap Column to "Auto" in Sublime Settings. This will cause the edited views to wrap correctly no matter the screen or window/pane size, as well as in Sublime's Distraction Free Mode.

        Whenever Traverse Mode is enabled on a view, word wrap for that view is turned off altogether to prevent awkward wrapping of trees. It is restored when Traverse Mode is turned off.

Details on the Sublime Implementation

    The Urtext package for Sublime Text utilizes Sublime's embedded Python 3.3 interpreter both to run the Urtext interpreter/compiler and to add features to Sublime that make working with Urtext easy:

        - binds many Urtext operations to the Sublime command palette
        - adds key bindings (hotkeys) as shortcuts for some features
        - leverages the built-in Sublime browser/palette for Urtext project navigation
        - defines a syntax for use with Sublime's color schemes
        - adds Urtext syntax highlighting to two of Sublime's default color schemes (Monokai and Sixteen)
        - adds filebrowser-like project navigation using "Traverse Mode"

    Some features in this documentation are built into the Urtext interpreter/compiler, while others are part of only the Sublime Text implementation. Features that are specific to Sublime are tagged with the keyword `sublime`.
Dependencies and Installation  

    The decision has been made not to include Urtext or its dependencies in the Urtext package for Sublime. It is necessary to install everything manually into Sublime's Python 3.3 environment. This is in fact less complicated than the alternatives considered. For developers, see "Make Installation Easier".

    To use Urtext in Sublime Text:

        - Install Sublime Text ( https://www.sublimetext.com/ )

        - Clone or download Sublime Urtext ( https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_sublime ). Place it in your Packages folder (Sublime Text 3/Packages). The package is not available in Package Control. 

        - Add Urtext and all its dependencies to Sublime's Python interpreter. There are two options for doing this:
Download and Install Dependencies Manually  

                - anytree
                    https://github.com/c0fec0de/anytree
                    The folder needed is `anytree` inside this download; add it to `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.
  
                - pytz
                    https://pypi.org/project/pytz/
                    The folder needed is `pytz`; add it to `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.

                - six
                    https://pypi.org/project/six/
                    The only FILE needed is `six.py`, nothing else; add this directly to `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.

                - urtext 
                    https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext
                    This is Urtext itself. Put the entire folder (`urtext`) into `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.

                - fuzzywuzzy 
                    https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy
                    The folder needed is `fuzzywuzzy`; add it to `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.
                
                - diff-match-patch
                    The folder needed is `diff_match_patch`; add it to `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3`.
                    https://pypi.org/project/diff-match-patch/
Download Dependencies from a Monorepo  

            As a convenience, all of the above depenencies are (for now) maintained in recent versions at https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps, with all files in the path locations described above. You can either download this repository as a .ZIP file and unzip it, or if you want to maintain version control, use:
                 `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`

            Put the contents of the cloned/unzipped folder (important: not the folder itself) directly into your `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3` folder.
Close and reopen Sublime Text. Urtext is now ready to use.

  Using Urtext in iOS with Pythonista
 
Urtext can be run on iOS devices using Pythonista, which provides a full Python interpreter inside of iOS. It is available in the iOS App Store.

This implementation utilizes the native iOS user interface to create a basic text editor view, along with buttons bound to Urtext's functions (similar to the keyboard shortcut bindings in Sublime), project navigation funtions, and syntax highlighting matching those found in the Sublime Text implementation. Using iCloud, projects can be synced among iOS devices and other devices (desktops, laptops). Once synced, a copy of the project resides fully on the device and is not dependent on a live data connection (see "Requirements and Features").

To set it up:

    - Install Pythonista (http://omz-software.com/pythonista/)

    - Clone or download the Urtext-Pythonista package (https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_pythonista).

    - Install all the Python dependencies into your Pythonista environment. The requirements are the same as for Sublime Text ("Dependencies and Installation" )

    - (optional) To enabling launching or switching to Urtext using an app icon, use the Shortcuts app.


Syntax Highlighting 

		This package comes with a .YML file (`sublime_urtext.sublime_syntax`) defining the Urtext syntax, along with two color schemes that provide syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting makes everything easier by showing depth of node nesting and dimming certain elements of the syntax. Select the Sixteen (for light) or Monokai (for dark) color schemes in Preferences -> Color Scheme ... 

		Then change to the Urtext syntax by selecting it in View -> Syntax -> Urtext. To avoid having to do this for every file, select View -> Syntax -> Open All with Current Extension As ... -> Urtext. (You can undo this later by repeating the same but selecting Plain Text.)

Time Zones 	  

  	Time zones are not required. If no time zone is present, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is added by default  for parsing and comparison purposes. To modify this default, set the `timezone` key in "project_settings" to another valid value.
