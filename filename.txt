Using Urtext in iOS with Pythonista
 
Urtext can be run on iOS devices using Pythonista, which provides a full Python interpreter inside of iOS. It is available in the iOS App Store.

This implementation utilizes the native iOS user interface to create a basic text editor view, along with buttons bound to Urtext's functions (similar to the keyboard shortcut bindings in Sublime), project navigation funtions, and syntax highlighting matching those found in the Sublime Text implementation. Using iCloud, projects can be synced among iOS devices and other devices (desktops, laptops). Once synced, a copy of the project resides fully on the device and is not dependent on a live data connection (see "Requirements and Features").

To set it up:

    - Install Pythonista (http://omz-software.com/pythonista/)

    - Clone or download the Urtext-Pythonista package (https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_pythonista).

    - Install all the Python dependencies into your Pythonista environment. The requirements are the same as for Sublime Text ("Dependencies and Installation" )

    - (optional) To enabling launching or switching to Urtext using an app icon, use the Shortcuts app.

Remove Indent Guides  

			Formatting plaintext using tab indentions can look messy if indent guides are on. To turn them off, add to your Sublime project settings file:
			%%-JSON
			 "settings" : 
				"draw_indent_guides": false,
			
			%%-END-JSON

Quick Start, Guides and Examples  
Installation and Setup (Desktop)

For desktop use (PC/Mac/Linux) Urtext is implemented in Sublime Text.

1. Download Sublime Text. (https://www.sublimetext.com/).

2. Download Urtext and all its dependencies from the monorepo at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. You can either download this repository as a .ZIP file and unzip it, or if you want to maintain version control, use `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_deps`. Put the contents of the cloned/unzipped folder (important: not the folder itself) directly into your `Sublime Text 3/Lib/python3.3` folder.

3. Download the Sublime Urtext package at `https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext_sublime`. Place it in your Packages folder (Sublime Text 3/Packages)

4. Clone/download this documentation repository and open its folder in Sublime. It will automatically be read as an Urtext project.

Once the Sublime package is installed, it will always look for any files with the .txt extension in open folders and attempt to compile them into a project. To open an existing Urtext project, open the folder, a file in the folder, or a Sublime project that includes the folder, and any feature described in this documentation will work.

To make a new project, open an empty folder and select Select `Urtext : Initialize Project` from the Sublime Command Palette. For more information, see "Projects".

	A few additional keys are reserved, but only for nodes containing project settings. See "project_settings".

Dynamic Definitions Quick-Reference

Dynamic definitions contain instructions for dynamically building nodes from the contents of other nodes. They can be written anywhere; it is not necessary to store the definition in the same file to which it refers. (Note that they cannot, however, be stored in the node they target, since they would overwrite themselves.)

Dynamic definitions are wrapped using double left and right square brackets:


%%-DOC

	Dynamic Definition Wrapper
		
	Note the dynamic definitions ignore whitespace and arbitrary text outside of functions.
	The order of functions within a definition is unimportant; they are evaluated as a group.

Operations

Built-in operations are bound to either hotkeys or to UI menus.

Hotkeys differ among operating systems and can be reassigned according to your preference by

Sublime Text Interface Tips  
	
	Here are some tips for best leveraging Sublime's great UI features.
Syntax Highlighting 

		This package comes with a .YML file (`sublime_urtext.sublime_syntax`) defining the Urtext syntax, along with two color schemes that provide syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting makes everything easier by showing depth of node nesting and dimming certain elements of the syntax. Select the Sixteen (for light) or Monokai (for dark) color schemes in Preferences -> Color Scheme ... 

		Then change to the Urtext syntax by selecting it in View -> Syntax -> Urtext. To avoid having to do this for every file, select View -> Syntax -> Open All with Current Extension As ... -> Urtext. (You can undo this later by repeating the same but selecting Plain Text.)
Hiding Tabs	

			If you prefer a clean, terminal-like view, hide tabs: View -> Hide Tabs
			This preference can also be set on a per-(Sublime)-project basis. See the Sublime documentation.
Hiding Line Numbers  

			For an extra-clean look, hide line numbers by adding:
				
				%%-JSON
				
				"settings" : 
					 "line_numbers": false,
				,
				
				%%-END-JSON

			... to your Sublime project settings file. (Ignore the JSON syntax pass makers above beginning with `%%`
			See "Pass Markers and Embedded Syntaxes" )
Full Screen / Distraction Free Mode  

			Since you can navigate entirely from within files, Urtext works great in Sublime's Distraction Free Mode. View -> Enter Distraction Free Mode.
Disable Prompts for File Reload 

			 Urtext does a lot of writing to files on the fly, often when they are already open. To avoid seeing a dialog every time, add add the following to your Sublime project settings or User Preferences file:
				 %%-JSON
				 "settings" : 
					"always_prompt_for_file_reload": false,
				,
				%%-END-JSON
Remove Indent Guides  

			Formatting plaintext using tab indentions can look messy if indent guides are on. To turn them off, add to your Sublime project settings file:
			%%-JSON
			 "settings" : 
				"draw_indent_guides": false,
			
			%%-END-JSON
Save on Focus Lost  

			Urtext recompiles your project every time a file changes. To make this more automatic, addto your Sublime settings file:
			%%-JSON
			 "save_on_focus_lost": true 
			%%-END-JSON
Using a Sublime Project for an Urtext Project  
	
			( see https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/projects.html )

			You don't need to define a Sublime Project for the Urtext Project, but if you intend to do more than one thing at a time in Sublime, it's convenient to have one; you can then use Select Project -> Quick Switch Project (Ctrl-Super-P) to switch among them.


Creating a Dynamic Node 

        Ctrl-Shift-] creates a new dynamic definition in Sublime.
        In Pythonista or other editors, create them manually.

Files 
        
		Links to files can be made by writing f> , followed immediately with a file path relative to the folder of the project:
		Example:   f>./README.md

Generating a node ID manually 
If you accidentally delete a Node ID or need to insert one arbitrarily, press Urtext-i.

Traverse ModeTraverse Mode   




This feature is currently implemented in Sublime Text only.

    You can navigate a node tree or list of nodes by turning on Traverse mode (Shift-Ctrl-R). This will open another pane next to the one you are currently in. As you navigate the nodeview in the left side with the cursor or mouse, the selected node shows on the right. Use Sublime's Focus Group navigation keys, or the mouse, to switch between left and right panes.
    
    Toggle Traverse Mode off by pressing Shift-Ctrl-R again. The status bar at the bottom of the Sublime window indicates whether Traverse is on or off. 

    Note that if Traverse mode is off, you can also open a link manually (Shift-Ctrl-/) as normal. 

    This feature is not built into Urtext; it is a feature of the Sublime package only.
Word Wrap in Traverse Mode 

        Since Traverse Mode splits the window into two or more panes, it is suggested to set Word Wrap Column to "Auto" in Sublime Settings. This will cause the edited views to wrap correctly no matter the screen or window/pane size, as well as in Sublime's Distraction Free Mode.

        Whenever Traverse Mode is enabled on a view, word wrap for that view is turned off altogether to prevent awkward wrapping of trees. It is restored when Traverse Mode is turned off.

Dynamically Titled Links  

    Prepending a pipe character to any node link will populate the space between the pipe and link with the node's title, from its metadata or default title. Examples are found throughout this documentation. 

    Titled links are updated at the single file level whenever that file is saved.

In-Progress / Experimental / Wish List
iPhone/iPad/iOS  
	
	Urtext can run on iOS using Pythonista. While it does not provide the elegant UI of Sublime Text, it can be set up to meet the project criteria described in[ MISSING LINK : 008 ] , including the requirement that the content wholly reside on every device and not depend on an internet connection.

	Pythonista can import and manipulate files directly in iCloud Drive. However, iCloud Drive does not always sync folder changes in the background, and/or syncs the file list without syncing full file contents. This makes it necessary to open the iOS Files app in order manually trigger a sync before using the Urtext project. In the event one or more files is missing or different among devices, these differences will propogate to dynamic nodes with wrong, stale, or missing information. When this occurs many times, file version conflicts develop.

	A cleaner solution using Dropbox is possible using the Synchronator module (https://github.com/markhamilton1/Synchronator). This module provides a route to automate explicit bidirectional syncing directly between Dropbox and Pythonista environment on demand, such as whenever the project is being used. The module is complicated to install.
Synchronator Setup   

		DOCUMENTATION COMING
Syncing manually comes with the drawback that changes made on the iOS device will not themselves sync to Dropbox in the background. For instance, if changes are made to a file on iOS while not connected to the internet and Pythonista, the project will have to be explictly synced at a later time. So there remains the possibility that projects will get out of sync.

Dynamic Nodes

Dynamic definitions contain instructions for dynamically building nodes from the contents of other nodes. Dynamic content remains up to date with its source content at all times. Dynamic definitions contain instructions for dynamically building nodes from the contents of other nodes. They can be written anywhere; it is not necessary to store the definition in the same file to which it refers. (Note that they cannot, however, be stored in the node they target, since they would overwrite themselves.)

The complete parameters and syntax are here : "Dynamic Definitions Quick-Reference"

This section illustrates more generally the use and purpose of dynamic nodes, with examples.

There are two main kinds of dynamic output: lists and collections: "Lists" are exactly that: lists of nodes, with each node displayed not more than once once. Lists can optionally expand into trees, showing the hierarchy of nested relationships from each root node in the list. Collections, on the other hand, show metadata entries with their context; the same node may appear many times in a colelction if it contains many metadata entries matching the queried parameters.

Urtext will parse node timestamps along with inline timestamps into a project timeline. Press Ctrl-Shift-T or select Urtext: Show Timeline in the Sublime command palette. Each node and inline timestamp is shown in chronological order with nearby text. You can try it with this example project, but note that since many nodes in this document are undated, they have a default date of Thu., Jan. 01, 1970, 12:00AM.

As everywhere in a project, node IDs shown are links that can be opened using Ctrl-Shift-/.



You can extend node trees beyond the file level by using "Pointers".

Collections

Collections are for "collecting" metadata entries, along with their context, in order to gain a range of views into the text content of a project. A common use for this would be to create a timeline from datetimestamps. Another use would be to collect all metadata entries of a given key, and optionally a given value, into a single view.

Project Naming (Identification) 

Unlike nodes, projects are uniquely identified by name. For this reason, each project must have an unique name within the running instance of Urtext. Projects can be named using the project_title key in the project's project_settings node. If no name is present, the project's name becomes its absolute path in the file system.

Requirements and Features   

        Many of the following features and benefits were core requirements when creating Urtext. Others came about indirectly. Though many can be found in other tools, they are not currently found together in one single existing tool; this was the motivation for creating Urtext.

            - It uses plain text files. Plaintext is fast, human-readable, flexible, cross-platform, device-portable, and future-proof.

            - It is usable across multiple platforms and devices.
 
            - Cascading complexity; use only the parts you need. Does not take months/years to learn.

            - Being open source, Urtext is extensible, hackable and customizable to specific needs.

            - It can compile, organize, and link content spread across hundreds or thousands of files. Files and content elements can be linked to one another in tree-like, recursive (tangled), and other non-hierarchical ways.

            - It has customizable and extensible metadata that does not rely on the file system.

            - It is decoupled from any particular text editor or interface ; it can be incorporated into any environment that runs Python, including any scriptable text editor or Python-scriptable environment capable of displaying a text editing view.
               
            - It can incorporate (embed) other plaintext syntaxes, including other markup languages and other programming language syntaxes.
   
            - There is no need to interact directly with the file system (creating, naming, saving, organizing files). File creation, naming and management is handled for you.
      
            - Future-proof. No reliance on anything that may not exist in 5 or 1000 years. Urtext files themselves are in plaintext, which is future-proof. The interpreter/compiler could be implemented in any sufficiently capable language desired, current, past or future.
   
            - Does not depend on a cloud service. Though cloud services can be used to sync project files among devices, the interpreter itself is made to operate locally; content wholly resides on the device being used.

            Being in plaintext and having a syntax specification, it can also be used with:

            - Themes and syntax highlighting.
            - Version control (Git, for example).

Collections

Collections are for "collecting" metadata entries, along with their context, in order to gain a range of views into the text content of a project. A common use for this would be to create a timeline from datetimestamps. Another use would be to collect all metadata entries of a given key, and optionally a given value, into a single view.

Pythonista  

        Use the `/` key when the cursor is on any line containing a link.

Compact Nodes

	For nodes that can fit on a single line, such as items in a list, short phrases, word definitions, and so on, you can use a simplified node syntax. Begin the line with the caret symbol (^); the closing wrapper then becomes the next newline (the end of the same line). Like other nodes:
require an ID
can have arbitrary other metadata
become child nodes of their containing node.

                (required) : In Sublime this will be auto-populated using the shortcut above; however you can also replace it with the ID of another node. For example, if you want the contents to replace an existing node, assign this key the value of that node's ID. If you want it to populate new inline node, create that node and then copy/paste its ID. 

                Note that in order to work, the target node must exist; dynamic definitions do not create their target nodes. 

                


            
             - include:metadata:[AND:|OR:](metadata key):(metadata value(s)): 
    
                Include nodes with this metadata key and value. Keys and values are chained together and separated by the colon (:) as shown above. Multiple values can be chained together with successive colons. The default operator is "OR"; for "AND", chain this indicator as shown before the tag name.  
                



            - exclude:metadata:(tag name):(tag values) 
    
                Exclude nodes with this metadata key and value. Keys and values are strung together and separated by the colon (:) as shown above. To exclude multiple key/value pairs, write multiple lines. Excluding will always supersede including, no matter the order listed in the definition. 
                


 
           - sort:(key):(reverse)
    
                This specifies how to sort the nodes in the dynamically populated node. The key can be any metadata key in the project, including timestamp. If `:reverse` is appended to the end, the sort order will be reversed.
                



            - metadata:(tag name):(value) 
    
                Metadata to add to the dynamically populated node. This can be any metadata, including the reserved title, index and parent keys.

		This package comes with a .YML file (`sublime_urtext.sublime_syntax`) defining the Urtext syntax, along with two color schemes that provide syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting makes everything easier by showing depth of node nesting and dimming certain elements of the syntax. Select the Sixteen (for light) or Monokai (for dark) color schemes in Preferences -> Color Scheme ... 

		Then change to the Urtext syntax by selecting it in View -> Syntax -> Urtext. To avoid having to do this for every file, select View -> Syntax -> Open All with Current Extension As ... -> Urtext. (You can undo this later by repeating the same but selecting Plain Text.)

Example 1 : List    

    Here are four inline nodes with example tags and indexes:
Example Source Node 1
Example Source Node 3
Example Source Node 2
Example Source Node 4
( Note that each of these nodes has the `exclude_from_tree` flag in the metadata, so that they are not included in the Table of Contents. See"`exclude_from_tree`". )

    Here is an example dynamic node definition targeting node ID[ MISSING LINK : 016 ] 

        [ MISSING LINK : 016 ] 

        Here is the compiled node defined by the definition above. Changing the dynamic definition and/or the contents or metadata of the source nodes will update the dynamic node. Saving is necessary to trigger the update.

Hiding Tabs	

			If you prefer a clean, terminal-like view, hide tabs: View -> Hide Tabs
			This preference can also be set on a per-(Sublime)-project basis. See the Sublime documentation.
Hiding Line Numbers  

			For an extra-clean look, hide line numbers by adding:
				
				%%-JSON
				
				"settings" : 
					 "line_numbers": false,
				,
				
				%%-END-JSON

			... to your Sublime project settings file. (Ignore the JSON syntax pass makers above beginning with `%%`
			See "Pass Markers and Embedded Syntaxes" )
Full Screen / Distraction Free Mode  

			Since you can navigate entirely from within files, Urtext works great in Sublime's Distraction Free Mode. View -> Enter Distraction Free Mode.
Disable Prompts for File Reload 

			 Urtext does a lot of writing to files on the fly, often when they are already open. To avoid seeing a dialog every time, add add the following to your Sublime project settings or User Preferences file:
				 %%-JSON
				 "settings" : 
					"always_prompt_for_file_reload": false,
				,
				%%-END-JSON
Remove Indent Guides  

			Formatting plaintext using tab indentions can look messy if indent guides are on. To turn them off, add to your Sublime project settings file:
			%%-JSON
			 "settings" : 
				"draw_indent_guides": false,
			
			%%-END-JSON
Save on Focus Lost  

			Urtext recompiles your project every time a file changes. To make this more automatic, addto your Sublime settings file:
			%%-JSON
			 "save_on_focus_lost": true 
			%%-END-JSON
Using a Sublime Project for an Urtext Project  
	
			( see https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/projects.html )

			You don't need to define a Sublime Project for the Urtext Project, but if you intend to do more than one thing at a time in Sublime, it's convenient to have one; you can then use Select Project -> Quick Switch Project (Ctrl-Super-P) to switch among them.

Opening Links
Sublime 

        Press Shift-Ctrl-/ on a line containing a link to open the node with the linked ID. If the link is to an inline node, Sublime will scroll to and center its starting point.
Pythonista  

        Use the `/` key when the cursor is on any line containing a link.
Note that Urtext reads node regions on every save, so cursor location may be imprecise if the file has been altered since the last save.
