"Table of Contents" Dynamic Definition

Here is the dynamic definition that generates the | Table of Contents >e5j for this documentation.

[[  ID(>e5j) (The target ID is the | Table of Contents >e5j)
	
	We include three specific root nodes by ID:
    +(ID=013) | About Urtext >013
    +(ID=z7t) | Quick Start, Guides and Examples >z7t
    +(ID=ac5) | Reference >ac5

    Here we use `*` for DEPTH, which means unlimited depth. Note that using | Pointers >lmu it is possible to create recursive trees. In this case, the tree will be drawn only to the first point of recursion. See | Recursive Node Pointers >6ct for more information. 
    DEPTH(*)

    For this documentation, we created a user-defined keyname `flags` to identify nodes that are examples/illustrations. We mark them for exclusion from the Table of Contents with they key `exclude_from_toc`. The following parameters accomplishes this:
    -(flags=exclude_from_toc)    

    Finally, we add a header, which also will also automatically set the node title. 
    HEADER(Table of Contents)
 ]]  


[[ 
	As a curiosity, we can see all the nodes that have been excluded from the Table of Contents:
	+(flags=exclude_from_toc)
	HEADER(Nodes Excluded from the Table of Contents)
	FOOTER(flags::exclude_from_toc)
	ID(>jkl)
    FORMAT(indent:3)

 ]]

    {
			Nodes Excluded from the Table of Contents
			Example first level >8fv
			The symbol below is a Pass Marker, which tells Urtext to skip everything between it and the closing >8e5
			This node is just here as a destination from the node pointer in  Basic Syntax >ttt
			flags::exclude_from_toc
			ID::jkl
			def::>v7r }
