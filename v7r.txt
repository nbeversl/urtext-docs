"Table of Contents" Dynamic Definition

Here is the dynamic definition that generates the | Table of Contents >e5j for this documentation:

[[  ID(>e5j) 
	
	We include three specific nodes by ID:
    +(ID=013) | About Urtext >013
    +(ID=z7t) | Quick Start, Guides and Examples >z7t
    +(ID=ac5) | Reference >ac5

    For this documentation, we created a user-defined keyname `flags` in order to be able to exclude certain nodes that would clutter the dynamic output, since they are just examples/illustrations. These have been marked with the value `exclude_from_tree`. The following parameters excludes them from the Table of Contents output:

    
    Here we use `*` for DEPTH, which means unlimited depth.
    DEPTH(20)

    Finally, we add a header, which also will also automatically set the node title. 
    HEADER(Table of Contents)
 ]]  


[[ 
	As a curiosity, we can see all the nodes that have been excluded from the Table of Contents:
	+(flags=exclude_from_tree -include-dynamic)
	HEADER(Nodes Excluded from the Table of Contents)
	FOOTER(flags::exclude_from_tree)
	ID(>jkl)

 ]]

{ Nodes Excluded from the Table of Contents

Example Source Node 2 >00v
Example Source Node 3 >01b
Example Source Node 4 >01c
The symbol below is a Pass Marker, which tells Urtext to skip everything between it and the closing >8e5
