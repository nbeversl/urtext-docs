Trees

{  Expanding a List with the DEPTH Parameter

	[[ 		

	This definition is mostly the same as the one in | Lists >twz. It targets the inline node below, | Example Tree >4gr. The difference is that we use the DEPTH parameter to indicate that under each list item, we would like to see the outline of nodes nested within it, up to 5 levels deep: DEPTH(5)

	It does not matter how you format the parameters; here they are strung together on a single line:
	ID(>4gr) +(*) LIMIT(20) FORMAT(indent:3) HEADER(Example Tree)

In practice most of these nodes have only a 2-3 levels of nesting. For an example of a larger tree, look at the | "Table of Contents" Dynamic Definition >>v7r
