UrText Syntax Guide

Text is plain content unless inside a metadata wrapper, timetamp wrapper, or dynamic definition wrapper. The following syntax applies:

	 >0y2	Link to another node by ID. More information: | Links >0y2

	 | 		Placed before a node link, dynamically populates the node title. 
	 		Example and more info: | Dynamically Titled Links >4vu

	 >>xxx	Node Pointer

	% 		Splits a node into two. Must be the first character on a line.
			More information: | (untitled) >k6d

	 ^		Compact Node marker. Must be the first non-whitespace character on a line.
	 		More information: | Compact Nodes >j6t

	{{  }}	Subnode	wrapper. Can appear anywhere. Can be nested aribrarily deep.
			More information: | Inline Nodes >004

	/-- --/ 														
	Metadata wrapper. Example:

		/--
			[key]:[value]												
			Metadata Pair, can contain any keys/values and optional timestamp.
			Some keys are reserved (see below). Keys are case-insensitive.

			;					
			Separator for metadata pairs

			|															
			Separator for multiple values in metadata pairs

			Reserved Metadata Keys, With Example Vales

			id: znj
				Uniquely identifies the node in the project. Required in strict mode.
				more info: | More About Node IDs >01q

			index:01					
				- Sets the index (priority) of the node in the project. more info: | index >00z

			timestamp:<Wed., Jun. 05, 2019, 10:01 PM>					
				Timestamp. more info: | Timestamps >005

			title: UrText Reference Guide								
				Overrides the Node Title. more info: | title (overrides the default title) >00y

			flags:exclude_from_tree										
				Sets node behavior. More info: | flags >cwb

			from:Joes-iMac
				Hostname of originating computer/device.

	[[ ]]	Dynamic Definition Wrapper. 

			Template:
			[[ OPERATOR(key:value:<timestamp> suboperator)]]

			Examples:
			[[ 
				
			ID(xxx) 	Target Node id, to dynamically populate with output

			INCLUDE()  	Nodes to include. Accepts multiple parameters.
						
						Examples:

						INCLUDE(all)	
						Includes all nodes in the project

						INCLUDE(indexed)	
						Includes all nodes in the project that have an index

						INCLUDE(key:value)	
						Includes all nodes with the given value in the given key

							Operators:

							"and"
							INCLUDE(key:value and other_key:other_value)
							Includes nodes matching both `key:value` and `other_key:other_value`

							"or"
							INCLUDE(key:value or other_key:other_value)
							Includes any nodes matching either or both of `key:value` and `other_key:other_value`

							"all_projects"
							INCLUDE(all_projects)
							Expands included nodes to include all projects in the project list.

							Optional Timestamp:
							
							INCLUDE(tags:cello:<2019> or tags:teaching:<2019>)
							Includes any nodes matching either or both of the key/value pairs within the corresponding timestamp.

			EXCLUDE()	Evaluated after INCLUDE(), excludes the given nodes from the result.
						Accepts the same parameters as INCLUDE()

			SHOW()		Formats the output, overriding defaults. Accepts arbitrary text, unicode newline characters (\n, \r), and tokens.
						Words preceded (without whitespace) by `$` are evaluated as tokens for the value of metadata keys.

						In addition to user-defined metadata keys, the following tokens are valid:
						SHOW(
							$title 
							Displays the node title, default or via the `title` meta key.

							$link
							Displays a link to the node

							 )

			TREE()

			TIMELINE()

			FORMAT()

			SEARCH()

			SORT()

			EXPORT()

			FILE()

			TAG_ALL()

			METADATA()
